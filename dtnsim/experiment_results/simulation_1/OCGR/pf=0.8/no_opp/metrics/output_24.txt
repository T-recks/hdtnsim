The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
366(10 to 6), 370(1 to 11), 372(1 to 6), 373(5 to 10), 374(4 to 1), 375(9 to 12), 378(3 to 9), 381(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(366: 3), (370: 2), (372: 1), (373: 1), (374: 1), (375: 1), (378: 2), (381: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 370: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 372: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 378: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4:

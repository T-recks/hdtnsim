The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
824(10 to 6), 828(1 to 11), 833(1 to 6), 834(5 to 10), 853(4 to 1), 858(9 to 12), 865(3 to 9), 889(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(833: 15.000000), (858: 0.000000), (865: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(824: 1), (828: 3), (833: 3), (834: 5), (853: 6), (858: 3), (865: 6), (889: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

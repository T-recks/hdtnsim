The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1008(10 to 6), 1022(1 to 11), 1026(1 to 6), 1027(5 to 10), 1056(4 to 1), 1060(9 to 12), 1078(3 to 9), 1106(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1026: 15.000000), (1056: 140.000000), (1060: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1008: 1), (1022: 2), (1026: 3), (1027: 4), (1056: 6), (1060: 3), (1078: 2), (1106: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

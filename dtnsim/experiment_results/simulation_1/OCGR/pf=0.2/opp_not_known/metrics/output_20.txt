The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
228(10 to 6), 246(1 to 11), 255(1 to 6), 256(5 to 10), 286(4 to 1), 292(9 to 12), 316(3 to 9), 348(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(228: 45.000000), (246: 35.000000), (255: 15.000000), (256: 35.000000), (286: 140.000000), (292: 0.000000), (348: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(228: 4), (246: 3), (255: 3), (256: 3), (286: 6), (292: 3), (316: 2), (348: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
219(10 to 6), 236(1 to 11), 244(1 to 6), 245(5 to 10), 275(4 to 1), 279(9 to 12), 299(3 to 9), 330(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(244: 15.000000), (245: 35.000000), (279: 0.000000), (299: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(219: 1), (236: 2), (244: 3), (245: 3), (275: 4), (279: 3), (299: 5), (330: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
192(10 to 6), 194(1 to 11), 198(1 to 6), 199(5 to 10), 215(4 to 1), 217(9 to 12), 220(3 to 9), 238(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(192: 1), (194: 2), (198: 1), (199: 5), (215: 4), (217: 4), (220: 7), (238: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

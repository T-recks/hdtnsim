The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
664(10 to 6), 668(1 to 11), 674(1 to 6), 675(5 to 10), 679(4 to 1), 682(9 to 12), 691(3 to 9), 697(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(664: 45.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(664: 4), (668: 2), (674: 1), (675: 1), (679: 1), (682: 3), (691: 2), (697: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:

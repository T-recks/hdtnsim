The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
507(10 to 6), 509(1 to 11), 513(1 to 6), 514(5 to 10), 531(4 to 1), 533(9 to 12), 543(3 to 9), 567(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(514: 35.000000), (533: 0.000000), (543: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(507: 1), (509: 2), (513: 1), (514: 7), (531: 5), (533: 3), (543: 6), (567: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

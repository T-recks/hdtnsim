The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1513(10 to 6), 1531(1 to 11), 1539(1 to 6), 1540(5 to 10), 1569(4 to 1), 1573(9 to 12), 1596(3 to 9), 1629(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1531: 35.000000), (1539: 15.000000), (1540: 35.000000), (1569: 60.000000), (1573: 0.000000), (1596: 65.000000), (1629: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1513: 1), (1531: 3), (1539: 3), (1540: 3), (1569: 4), (1573: 3), (1596: 4), (1629: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1374(10 to 6), 1377(1 to 11), 1380(1 to 6), 1381(5 to 10), 1398(4 to 1), 1399(9 to 12), 1406(3 to 9), 1425(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1399: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1374: 3), (1377: 2), (1380: 1), (1381: 4), (1398: 6), (1399: 3), (1406: 5), (1425: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
475(10 to 6), 477(1 to 11), 481(1 to 6), 482(5 to 10), 499(4 to 1), 501(9 to 12), 509(3 to 9), 530(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(501: 0.000000), (509: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(475: 4), (477: 2), (481: 1), (482: 9), (499: 2), (501: 3), (509: 7), (530: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

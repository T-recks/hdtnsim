The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
497(10 to 6), 501(1 to 11), 504(1 to 6), 505(5 to 10), 523(4 to 1), 525(9 to 12), 533(3 to 9), 560(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(505: 55.000000), (525: 0.000000), (533: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(497: 4), (501: 2), (504: 1), (505: 9), (523: 2), (525: 3), (533: 4), (560: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

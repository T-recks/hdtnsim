The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
544(10 to 6), 549(1 to 11), 557(1 to 6), 558(5 to 10), 575(4 to 1), 578(9 to 12), 589(3 to 9), 614(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(544: 45.000000), (558: 35.000000), (575: 60.000000), (578: 0.000000), (589: 15.000000), (614: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(544: 4), (549: 2), (557: 1), (558: 3), (575: 4), (578: 3), (589: 4), (614: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(10 to 6), 221(1 to 11), 225(1 to 6), 226(5 to 10), 255(4 to 1), 260(9 to 12), 277(3 to 9), 305(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 1), (221: 2), (225: 3), (226: 5), (255: 4), (260: 4), (277: 2), (305: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1498(10 to 6), 1516(1 to 11), 1525(1 to 6), 1526(5 to 10), 1555(4 to 1), 1558(9 to 12), 1576(3 to 9), 1609(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1498: 45.000000), (1558: 0.000000), (1576: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1498: 4), (1516: 2), (1525: 1), (1526: 5), (1555: 4), (1558: 3), (1576: 5), (1609: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

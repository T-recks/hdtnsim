The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
220(10 to 6), 236(1 to 11), 243(1 to 6), 244(5 to 10), 274(4 to 1), 280(9 to 12), 302(3 to 9), 336(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(220: 45.000000), (236: 55.000000), (243: 15.000000), (280: 0.000000), (302: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(220: 4), (236: 5), (243: 3), (244: 4), (274: 3), (280: 3), (302: 4), (336: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

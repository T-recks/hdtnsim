The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
240(10 to 6), 242(1 to 11), 246(1 to 6), 247(5 to 10), 250(4 to 1), 252(9 to 12), 256(3 to 9), 258(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(246: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(240: 1), (242: 2), (246: 2), (247: 1), (250: 1), (252: 1), (256: 2), (258: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 242: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 246: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 242: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 246: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 256: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 250: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 247: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 252: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10:

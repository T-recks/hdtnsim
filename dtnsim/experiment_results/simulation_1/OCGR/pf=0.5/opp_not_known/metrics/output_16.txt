The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
621(10 to 6), 635(1 to 11), 638(1 to 6), 639(5 to 10), 667(4 to 1), 668(9 to 12), 685(3 to 9), 716(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(667: 60.000000), (668: 55.000000), (685: 65.000000), (716: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(621: 1), (635: 2), (638: 1), (639: 4), (667: 4), (668: 4), (685: 4), (716: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

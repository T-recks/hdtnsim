The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1281(10 to 6), 1284(1 to 11), 1289(1 to 6), 1290(5 to 10), 1304(4 to 1), 1305(9 to 12), 1312(3 to 9), 1332(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1284: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1281: 1), (1284: 5), (1289: 1), (1290: 5), (1304: 4), (1305: 4), (1312: 2), (1332: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
525(10 to 6), 531(1 to 11), 539(1 to 6), 540(5 to 10), 545(4 to 1), 547(9 to 12), 559(3 to 9), 569(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(531: 35.000000), (539: 25.000000), (540: 35.000000), (545: 60.000000), (559: 65.000000), (569: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(525: 1), (531: 3), (539: 2), (540: 3), (545: 4), (547: 1), (559: 4), (569: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

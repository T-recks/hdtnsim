The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1442(10 to 6), 1448(1 to 11), 1452(1 to 6), 1453(5 to 10), 1470(4 to 1), 1471(9 to 12), 1479(3 to 9), 1504(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1442: 105.000000), (1471: 0.000000), (1479: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1442: 5), (1448: 2), (1452: 1), (1453: 4), (1470: 4), (1471: 3), (1479: 4), (1504: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

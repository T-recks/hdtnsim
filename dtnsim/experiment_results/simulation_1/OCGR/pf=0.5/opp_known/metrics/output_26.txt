The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
480(10 to 6), 484(1 to 11), 489(1 to 6), 490(5 to 10), 507(4 to 1), 511(9 to 12), 519(3 to 9), 539(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(484: 65.000000), (489: 15.000000), (490: 55.000000), (511: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(480: 4), (484: 5), (489: 3), (490: 4), (507: 2), (511: 3), (519: 5), (539: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

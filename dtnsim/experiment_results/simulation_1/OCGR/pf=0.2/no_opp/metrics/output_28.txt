The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
494(10 to 6), 497(1 to 11), 504(1 to 6), 505(5 to 10), 510(4 to 1), 513(9 to 12), 520(3 to 9), 527(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(504: 25.000000), (520: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(494: 1), (497: 3), (504: 2), (505: 2), (510: 4), (513: 1), (520: 5), (527: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

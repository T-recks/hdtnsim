The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
808(10 to 6), 811(1 to 11), 815(1 to 6), 816(5 to 10), 833(4 to 1), 838(9 to 12), 847(3 to 9), 871(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(811: 55.000000), (815: 15.000000), (816: 55.000000), (838: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(808: 3), (811: 6), (815: 3), (816: 5), (833: 5), (838: 3), (847: 2), (871: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

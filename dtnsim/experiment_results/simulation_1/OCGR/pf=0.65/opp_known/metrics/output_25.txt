The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
191(10 to 6), 194(1 to 11), 196(1 to 6), 197(5 to 10), 213(4 to 1), 215(9 to 12), 221(3 to 9), 237(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 3), (194: 2), (196: 1), (197: 5), (213: 4), (215: 4), (221: 2), (237: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

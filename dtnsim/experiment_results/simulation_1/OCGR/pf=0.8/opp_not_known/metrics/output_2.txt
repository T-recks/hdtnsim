The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
969(10 to 6), 983(1 to 11), 985(1 to 6), 986(5 to 10), 1013(4 to 1), 1014(9 to 12), 1030(3 to 9), 1058(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1013: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(969: 1), (983: 2), (985: 1), (986: 4), (1013: 6), (1014: 4), (1030: 2), (1058: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

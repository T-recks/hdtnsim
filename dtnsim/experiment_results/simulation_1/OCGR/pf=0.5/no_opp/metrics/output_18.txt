The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
379(10 to 6), 382(1 to 11), 386(1 to 6), 387(5 to 10), 390(4 to 1), 391(9 to 12), 397(3 to 9), 405(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(390: 60.000000), (405: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(379: 1), (382: 2), (386: 1), (387: 1), (390: 4), (391: 1), (397: 4), (405: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 382: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

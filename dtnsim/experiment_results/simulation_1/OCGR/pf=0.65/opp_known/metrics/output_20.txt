The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
202(10 to 6), 206(1 to 11), 212(1 to 6), 213(5 to 10), 231(4 to 1), 235(9 to 12), 243(3 to 9), 262(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(206: 65.000000), (212: 15.000000), (235: 0.000000), (243: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(202: 1), (206: 5), (212: 3), (213: 4), (231: 4), (235: 3), (243: 7), (262: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

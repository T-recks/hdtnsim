The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
383(10 to 6), 388(1 to 11), 395(1 to 6), 396(5 to 10), 401(4 to 1), 402(9 to 12), 407(3 to 9), 411(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(383: 1), (388: 2), (395: 1), (396: 2), (401: 1), (402: 3), (407: 2), (411: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

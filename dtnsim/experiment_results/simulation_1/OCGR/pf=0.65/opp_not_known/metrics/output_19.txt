The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1770(10 to 6), 1785(1 to 11), 1790(1 to 6), 1791(5 to 10), 1817(4 to 1), 1818(9 to 12), 1837(3 to 9), 1869(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1785: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1770: 1), (1785: 5), (1790: 1), (1791: 5), (1817: 4), (1818: 4), (1837: 2), (1869: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
357(10 to 6), 361(1 to 11), 364(1 to 6), 365(5 to 10), 368(4 to 1), 369(9 to 12), 375(3 to 9), 378(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(357: 1), (361: 3), (364: 1), (365: 1), (368: 1), (369: 2), (375: 2), (378: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

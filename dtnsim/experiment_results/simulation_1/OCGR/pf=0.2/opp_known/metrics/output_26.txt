The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
529(10 to 6), 535(1 to 11), 543(1 to 6), 544(5 to 10), 562(4 to 1), 568(9 to 12), 582(3 to 9), 603(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(529: 45.000000), (535: 35.000000), (543: 15.000000), (544: 55.000000), (568: 0.000000), (582: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(529: 4), (535: 3), (543: 3), (544: 4), (562: 3), (568: 3), (582: 4), (603: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

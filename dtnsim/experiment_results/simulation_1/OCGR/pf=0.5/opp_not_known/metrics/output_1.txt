The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
632(10 to 6), 646(1 to 11), 650(1 to 6), 651(5 to 10), 680(4 to 1), 682(9 to 12), 704(3 to 9), 734(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(682: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(632: 5), (646: 2), (650: 1), (651: 8), (680: 3), (682: 3), (704: 2), (734: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

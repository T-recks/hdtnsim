The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(10 to 6), 198(1 to 11), 204(1 to 6), 205(5 to 10), 219(4 to 1), 220(9 to 12), 227(3 to 9), 247(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(205: 35.000000), (219: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 1), (198: 3), (204: 1), (205: 3), (219: 6), (220: 4), (227: 5), (247: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

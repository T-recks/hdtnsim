The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
61(10 to 6), 62(1 to 11), 66(1 to 6), 67(5 to 10), 70(4 to 1), 73(9 to 12), 78(3 to 9), 81(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(61: 1), (62: 4), (66: 3), (67: 1), (70: 1), (73: 1), (78: 2), (81: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 62: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 66: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 62: (to: 4, time: 60.000000),

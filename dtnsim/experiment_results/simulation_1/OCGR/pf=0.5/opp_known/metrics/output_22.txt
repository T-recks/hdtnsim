The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
797(10 to 6), 800(1 to 11), 804(1 to 6), 805(5 to 10), 824(4 to 1), 829(9 to 12), 835(3 to 9), 858(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(804: 15.000000), (829: 0.000000), (835: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(797: 1), (800: 3), (804: 3), (805: 5), (824: 6), (829: 3), (835: 6), (858: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

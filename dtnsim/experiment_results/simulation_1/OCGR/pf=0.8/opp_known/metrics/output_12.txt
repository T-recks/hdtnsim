The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
721(10 to 6), 724(1 to 11), 726(1 to 6), 727(5 to 10), 742(4 to 1), 743(9 to 12), 748(3 to 9), 768(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(743: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(721: 3), (724: 2), (726: 1), (727: 5), (742: 4), (743: 4), (748: 2), (768: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
996(10 to 6), 1010(1 to 11), 1012(1 to 6), 1013(5 to 10), 1040(4 to 1), 1041(9 to 12), 1058(3 to 9), 1086(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1040: 140.000000), (1041: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(996: 1), (1010: 2), (1012: 1), (1013: 4), (1040: 6), (1041: 4), (1058: 2), (1086: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

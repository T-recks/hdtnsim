The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
667(10 to 6), 685(1 to 11), 690(1 to 6), 691(5 to 10), 720(4 to 1), 722(9 to 12), 747(3 to 9), 780(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(667: 105.000000), (685: 35.000000), (691: 55.000000), (720: 60.000000), (722: 55.000000), (747: 65.000000), (780: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(667: 5), (685: 3), (690: 1), (691: 8), (720: 4), (722: 4), (747: 4), (780: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

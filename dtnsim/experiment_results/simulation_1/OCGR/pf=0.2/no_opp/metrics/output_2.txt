The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
365(10 to 6), 370(1 to 11), 376(1 to 6), 377(5 to 10), 381(4 to 1), 383(9 to 12), 394(3 to 9), 402(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(370: 35.000000), (376: 25.000000), (377: 35.000000), (402: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(365: 1), (370: 3), (376: 2), (377: 3), (381: 1), (383: 1), (394: 2), (402: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
142(10 to 6), 145(1 to 11), 148(1 to 6), 149(5 to 10), 153(4 to 1), 156(9 to 12), 162(3 to 9), 168(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(148: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(142: 4), (145: 3), (148: 2), (149: 4), (153: 2), (156: 2), (162: 2), (168: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 145: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
370(10 to 6), 373(1 to 11), 376(1 to 6), 377(5 to 10), 379(4 to 1), 380(9 to 12), 383(3 to 9), 387(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(370: 1), (373: 2), (376: 1), (377: 1), (379: 2), (380: 2), (383: 2), (387: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 373: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 376: (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

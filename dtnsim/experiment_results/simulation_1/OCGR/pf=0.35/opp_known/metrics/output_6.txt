The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
524(10 to 6), 529(1 to 11), 535(1 to 6), 536(5 to 10), 554(4 to 1), 558(9 to 12), 569(3 to 9), 594(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(524: 45.000000), (536: 35.000000), (558: 0.000000), (569: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(524: 4), (529: 2), (535: 1), (536: 7), (554: 3), (558: 3), (569: 4), (594: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

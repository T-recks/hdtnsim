The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1072(10 to 6), 1088(1 to 11), 1093(1 to 6), 1094(5 to 10), 1125(4 to 1), 1130(9 to 12), 1149(3 to 9), 1180(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1093: 15.000000), (1130: 0.000000), (1149: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1072: 1), (1088: 2), (1093: 3), (1094: 5), (1125: 6), (1130: 3), (1149: 6), (1180: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

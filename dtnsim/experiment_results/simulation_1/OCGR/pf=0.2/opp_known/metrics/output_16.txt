The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
535(10 to 6), 541(1 to 11), 546(1 to 6), 547(5 to 10), 564(4 to 1), 566(9 to 12), 579(3 to 9), 602(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(535: 105.000000), (541: 35.000000), (547: 55.000000), (564: 60.000000), (566: 55.000000), (579: 15.000000), (602: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(535: 5), (541: 3), (546: 1), (547: 8), (564: 4), (566: 4), (579: 4), (602: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

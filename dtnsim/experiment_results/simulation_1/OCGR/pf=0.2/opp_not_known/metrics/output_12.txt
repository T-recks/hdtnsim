The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1096(10 to 6), 1112(1 to 11), 1116(1 to 6), 1117(5 to 10), 1147(4 to 1), 1152(9 to 12), 1176(3 to 9), 1209(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1112: 35.000000), (1116: 15.000000), (1117: 35.000000), (1147: 140.000000), (1152: 0.000000), (1209: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1096: 3), (1112: 4), (1116: 3), (1117: 3), (1147: 6), (1152: 3), (1176: 2), (1209: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

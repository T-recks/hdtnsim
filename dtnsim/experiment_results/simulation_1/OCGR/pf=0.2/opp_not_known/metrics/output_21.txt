The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
673(10 to 6), 689(1 to 11), 697(1 to 6), 698(5 to 10), 726(4 to 1), 728(9 to 12), 752(3 to 9), 785(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(673: 105.000000), (698: 35.000000), (728: 0.000000), (752: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(673: 5), (689: 2), (697: 1), (698: 3), (726: 2), (728: 3), (752: 5), (785: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

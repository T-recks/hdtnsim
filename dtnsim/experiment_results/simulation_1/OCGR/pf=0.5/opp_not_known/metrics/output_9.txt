The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1858(10 to 6), 1873(1 to 11), 1876(1 to 6), 1877(5 to 10), 1906(4 to 1), 1907(9 to 12), 1926(3 to 9), 1955(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1907: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1858: 3), (1873: 2), (1876: 1), (1877: 4), (1906: 6), (1907: 3), (1926: 2), (1955: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

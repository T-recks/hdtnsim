The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1545(10 to 6), 1563(1 to 11), 1571(1 to 6), 1572(5 to 10), 1600(4 to 1), 1603(9 to 12), 1629(3 to 9), 1662(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1545: 45.000000), (1563: 35.000000), (1572: 35.000000), (1600: 60.000000), (1603: 0.000000), (1629: 65.000000), (1662: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1545: 4), (1563: 3), (1571: 1), (1572: 3), (1600: 4), (1603: 3), (1629: 4), (1662: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

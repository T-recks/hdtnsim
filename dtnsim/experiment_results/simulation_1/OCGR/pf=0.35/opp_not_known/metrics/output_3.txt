The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1509(10 to 6), 1525(1 to 11), 1530(1 to 6), 1531(5 to 10), 1561(4 to 1), 1566(9 to 12), 1587(3 to 9), 1617(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1530: 15.000000), (1566: 0.000000), (1587: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1509: 3), (1525: 3), (1530: 3), (1531: 4), (1561: 4), (1566: 3), (1587: 5), (1617: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

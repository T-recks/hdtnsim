The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1850(10 to 6), 1865(1 to 11), 1871(1 to 6), 1872(5 to 10), 1900(4 to 1), 1901(9 to 12), 1924(3 to 9), 1953(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1865: 35.000000), (1901: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1850: 1), (1865: 3), (1871: 1), (1872: 4), (1900: 4), (1901: 3), (1924: 2), (1953: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

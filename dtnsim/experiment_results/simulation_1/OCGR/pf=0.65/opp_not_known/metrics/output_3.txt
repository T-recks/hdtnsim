The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1383(10 to 6), 1397(1 to 11), 1401(1 to 6), 1402(5 to 10), 1429(4 to 1), 1430(9 to 12), 1447(3 to 9), 1476(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1383: 1), (1397: 2), (1401: 1), (1402: 4), (1429: 4), (1430: 4), (1447: 2), (1476: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1437(10 to 6), 1452(1 to 11), 1457(1 to 6), 1458(5 to 10), 1485(4 to 1), 1486(9 to 12), 1506(3 to 9), 1538(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1486: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1437: 1), (1452: 2), (1457: 1), (1458: 5), (1485: 4), (1486: 3), (1506: 2), (1538: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

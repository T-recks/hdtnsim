The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1990(10 to 6), 2009(1 to 11), 2017(1 to 6), 2018(5 to 10), 2047(4 to 1), 2050(9 to 12), 2076(3 to 9), 2110(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1990: 45.000000), (2009: 35.000000), (2018: 35.000000), (2047: 60.000000), (2050: 0.000000), (2110: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1990: 4), (2009: 3), (2017: 1), (2018: 3), (2047: 4), (2050: 3), (2076: 4), (2110: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
984(10 to 6), 985(1 to 11), 987(1 to 6), 988(5 to 10), 1003(4 to 1), 1004(9 to 12), 1009(3 to 9), 1028(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(984: 1), (985: 2), (987: 1), (988: 4), (1003: 4), (1004: 4), (1009: 5), (1028: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1419(10 to 6), 1436(1 to 11), 1439(1 to 6), 1440(5 to 10), 1468(4 to 1), 1472(9 to 12), 1490(3 to 9), 1520(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1439: 15.000000), (1472: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1419: 1), (1436: 2), (1439: 3), (1440: 4), (1468: 4), (1472: 4), (1490: 3), (1520: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

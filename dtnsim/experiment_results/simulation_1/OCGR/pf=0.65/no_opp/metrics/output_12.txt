The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
258(10 to 6), 261(1 to 11), 265(1 to 6), 266(5 to 10), 269(4 to 1), 270(9 to 12), 274(3 to 9), 279(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(258: 3), (261: 2), (265: 1), (266: 2), (269: 1), (270: 1), (274: 2), (279: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 261: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 265: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 274: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
985(10 to 6), 988(1 to 11), 990(1 to 6), 991(5 to 10), 1007(4 to 1), 1011(9 to 12), 1016(3 to 9), 1035(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(990: 15.000000), (1011: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(985: 1), (988: 3), (990: 3), (991: 4), (1007: 4), (1011: 4), (1016: 5), (1035: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
193(10 to 6), 197(1 to 11), 201(1 to 6), 202(5 to 10), 219(4 to 1), 224(9 to 12), 229(3 to 9), 247(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 15.000000), (229: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(193: 1), (197: 3), (201: 3), (202: 5), (219: 4), (224: 4), (229: 7), (247: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
740(10 to 6), 742(1 to 11), 745(1 to 6), 746(5 to 10), 762(4 to 1), 763(9 to 12), 770(3 to 9), 789(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(740: 1), (742: 3), (745: 1), (746: 4), (762: 4), (763: 4), (770: 5), (789: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

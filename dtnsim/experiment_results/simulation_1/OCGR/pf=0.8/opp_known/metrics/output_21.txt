The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
465(10 to 6), 466(1 to 11), 469(1 to 6), 470(5 to 10), 486(4 to 1), 487(9 to 12), 494(3 to 9), 511(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(487: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(465: 1), (466: 2), (469: 1), (470: 4), (486: 4), (487: 3), (494: 5), (511: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

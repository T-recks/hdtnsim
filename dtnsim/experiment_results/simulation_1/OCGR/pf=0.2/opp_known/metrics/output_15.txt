The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
211(10 to 6), 214(1 to 11), 219(1 to 6), 220(5 to 10), 239(4 to 1), 245(9 to 12), 257(3 to 9), 284(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(214: 55.000000), (219: 15.000000), (239: 60.000000), (245: 0.000000), (257: 15.000000), (284: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(211: 1), (214: 6), (219: 3), (220: 9), (239: 4), (245: 3), (257: 4), (284: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

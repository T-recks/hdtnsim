The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1987(10 to 6), 2003(1 to 11), 2010(1 to 6), 2011(5 to 10), 2040(4 to 1), 2041(9 to 12), 2067(3 to 9), 2099(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2003: 35.000000), (2011: 35.000000), (2040: 140.000000), (2041: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1987: 1), (2003: 3), (2010: 1), (2011: 3), (2040: 6), (2041: 3), (2067: 2), (2099: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

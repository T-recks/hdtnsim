The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
84(10 to 6), 90(1 to 11), 99(1 to 6), 100(5 to 10), 106(4 to 1), 110(9 to 12), 120(3 to 9), 126(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(84: 45.000000), (90: 35.000000), (99: 65.000000), (100: 35.000000), (126: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(84: 4), (90: 3), (99: 3), (100: 3), (106: 1), (110: 2), (120: 2), (126: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

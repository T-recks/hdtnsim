The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
188(10 to 6), 190(1 to 11), 193(1 to 6), 194(5 to 10), 210(4 to 1), 211(9 to 12), 215(3 to 9), 232(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(211: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(188: 1), (190: 2), (193: 1), (194: 4), (210: 5), (211: 3), (215: 5), (232: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 190: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1041(10 to 6), 1056(1 to 11), 1060(1 to 6), 1061(5 to 10), 1092(4 to 1), 1097(9 to 12), 1115(3 to 9), 1145(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1060: 15.000000), (1097: 0.000000), (1115: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1041: 1), (1056: 2), (1060: 3), (1061: 5), (1092: 6), (1097: 3), (1115: 6), (1145: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

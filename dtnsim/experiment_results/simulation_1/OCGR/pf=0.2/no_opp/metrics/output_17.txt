The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
352(10 to 6), 356(1 to 11), 363(1 to 6), 364(5 to 10), 366(4 to 1), 367(9 to 12), 378(3 to 9), 388(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(352: 55.000000), (356: 35.000000), (378: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(352: 4), (356: 3), (363: 1), (364: 1), (366: 3), (367: 1), (378: 4), (388: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

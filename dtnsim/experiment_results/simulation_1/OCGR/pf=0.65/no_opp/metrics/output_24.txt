The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
445(10 to 6), 450(1 to 11), 453(1 to 6), 454(5 to 10), 456(4 to 1), 457(9 to 12), 460(3 to 9), 465(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(445: 3), (450: 2), (453: 1), (454: 1), (456: 1), (457: 1), (460: 2), (465: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 450: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 453: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 460: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1201(10 to 6), 1207(1 to 11), 1215(1 to 6), 1216(5 to 10), 1233(4 to 1), 1237(9 to 12), 1251(3 to 9), 1275(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1207: 35.000000), (1215: 15.000000), (1216: 35.000000), (1233: 60.000000), (1237: 0.000000), (1251: 15.000000), (1275: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1201: 1), (1207: 3), (1215: 3), (1216: 3), (1233: 4), (1237: 3), (1251: 4), (1275: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
513(10 to 6), 516(1 to 11), 520(1 to 6), 521(5 to 10), 525(4 to 1), 526(9 to 12), 532(3 to 9), 537(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(537: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(513: 1), (516: 2), (520: 1), (521: 2), (525: 1), (526: 2), (532: 2), (537: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 516: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 520: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 532: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4:

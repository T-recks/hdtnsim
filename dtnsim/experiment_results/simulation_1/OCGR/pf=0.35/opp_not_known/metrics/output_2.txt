The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1085(10 to 6), 1102(1 to 11), 1106(1 to 6), 1107(5 to 10), 1136(4 to 1), 1140(9 to 12), 1161(3 to 9), 1191(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1106: 15.000000), (1136: 140.000000), (1140: 0.000000), (1191: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1085: 1), (1102: 2), (1106: 3), (1107: 4), (1136: 6), (1140: 3), (1161: 2), (1191: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1142(10 to 6), 1148(1 to 11), 1156(1 to 6), 1157(5 to 10), 1174(4 to 1), 1178(9 to 12), 1189(3 to 9), 1212(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1148: 35.000000), (1156: 15.000000), (1157: 35.000000), (1174: 60.000000), (1178: 0.000000), (1189: 15.000000), (1212: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1142: 1), (1148: 3), (1156: 3), (1157: 3), (1174: 4), (1178: 3), (1189: 4), (1212: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

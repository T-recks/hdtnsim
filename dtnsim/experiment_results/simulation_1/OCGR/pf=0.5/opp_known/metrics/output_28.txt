The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1071(10 to 6), 1074(1 to 11), 1079(1 to 6), 1080(5 to 10), 1095(4 to 1), 1096(9 to 12), 1104(3 to 9), 1129(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1096: 0.000000), (1104: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1071: 1), (1074: 2), (1079: 1), (1080: 5), (1095: 4), (1096: 3), (1104: 6), (1129: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

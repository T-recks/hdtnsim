The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
488(10 to 6), 491(1 to 11), 496(1 to 6), 497(5 to 10), 502(4 to 1), 504(9 to 12), 513(3 to 9), 522(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(491: 35.000000), (497: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(488: 1), (491: 3), (496: 3), (497: 3), (502: 2), (504: 2), (513: 3), (522: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:

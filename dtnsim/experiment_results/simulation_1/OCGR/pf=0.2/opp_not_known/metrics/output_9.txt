The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
2015(10 to 6), 2031(1 to 11), 2037(1 to 6), 2038(5 to 10), 2068(4 to 1), 2072(9 to 12), 2096(3 to 9), 2129(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(2015: 45.000000), (2038: 35.000000), (2068: 140.000000), (2072: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(2015: 4), (2031: 2), (2037: 1), (2038: 7), (2068: 6), (2072: 3), (2096: 2), (2129: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

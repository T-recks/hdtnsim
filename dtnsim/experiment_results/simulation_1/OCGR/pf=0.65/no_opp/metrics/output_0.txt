The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
64(10 to 6), 66(1 to 11), 72(1 to 6), 73(5 to 10), 75(4 to 1), 76(9 to 12), 81(3 to 9), 85(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(73: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(64: 1), (66: 2), (72: 1), (73: 3), (75: 1), (76: 1), (81: 2), (85: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 66: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 72: (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

Node 3: 
Bundle 66: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 81: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 73: (to: 11, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 75: (to: 5, time: 70.000000),

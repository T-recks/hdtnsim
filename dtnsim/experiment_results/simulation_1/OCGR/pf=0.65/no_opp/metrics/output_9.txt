The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
409(10 to 6), 411(1 to 11), 413(1 to 6), 414(5 to 10), 417(4 to 1), 418(9 to 12), 421(3 to 9), 424(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(409: 1), (411: 2), (413: 1), (414: 1), (417: 1), (418: 1), (421: 2), (424: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 411: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 413: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 421: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 417: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 414: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Bundle 424: (to: 1, time: 110.000000), 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 418: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10:

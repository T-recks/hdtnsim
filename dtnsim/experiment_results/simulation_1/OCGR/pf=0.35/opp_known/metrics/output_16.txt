The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
508(10 to 6), 511(1 to 11), 514(1 to 6), 515(5 to 10), 531(4 to 1), 532(9 to 12), 540(3 to 9), 561(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(531: 60.000000), (532: 55.000000), (540: 15.000000), (561: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(508: 1), (511: 2), (514: 1), (515: 4), (531: 4), (532: 4), (540: 4), (561: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

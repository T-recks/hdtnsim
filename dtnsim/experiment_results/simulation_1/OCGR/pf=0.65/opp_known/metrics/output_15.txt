The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
196(10 to 6), 199(1 to 11), 203(1 to 6), 204(5 to 10), 221(4 to 1), 223(9 to 12), 226(3 to 9), 245(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(226: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(196: 1), (199: 2), (203: 1), (204: 5), (221: 2), (223: 4), (226: 7), (245: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

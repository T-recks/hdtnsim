The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1108(10 to 6), 1112(1 to 11), 1117(1 to 6), 1118(5 to 10), 1135(4 to 1), 1138(9 to 12), 1148(3 to 9), 1170(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1108: 45.000000), (1135: 60.000000), (1138: 0.000000), (1148: 15.000000), (1170: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1108: 4), (1112: 2), (1117: 1), (1118: 4), (1135: 4), (1138: 3), (1148: 4), (1170: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

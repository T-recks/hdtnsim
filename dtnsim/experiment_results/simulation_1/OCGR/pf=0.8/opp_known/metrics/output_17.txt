The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
712(10 to 6), 714(1 to 11), 717(1 to 6), 718(5 to 10), 734(4 to 1), 735(9 to 12), 740(3 to 9), 758(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(712: 1), (714: 3), (717: 1), (718: 4), (734: 4), (735: 4), (740: 5), (758: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

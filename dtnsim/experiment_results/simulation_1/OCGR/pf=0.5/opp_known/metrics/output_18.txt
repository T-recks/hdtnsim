The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1068(10 to 6), 1071(1 to 11), 1075(1 to 6), 1076(5 to 10), 1093(4 to 1), 1094(9 to 12), 1103(3 to 9), 1125(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1093: 60.000000), (1094: 0.000000), (1103: 15.000000), (1125: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1068: 1), (1071: 2), (1075: 1), (1076: 4), (1093: 4), (1094: 3), (1103: 4), (1125: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
661(10 to 6), 678(1 to 11), 683(1 to 6), 684(5 to 10), 712(4 to 1), 713(9 to 12), 734(3 to 9), 767(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(661: 105.000000), (684: 35.000000), (712: 60.000000), (713: 0.000000), (767: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(661: 5), (678: 2), (683: 1), (684: 3), (712: 4), (713: 3), (734: 2), (767: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

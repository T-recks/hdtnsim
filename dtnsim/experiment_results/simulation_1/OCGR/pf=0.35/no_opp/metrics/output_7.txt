The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
328(10 to 6), 331(1 to 11), 336(1 to 6), 337(5 to 10), 341(4 to 1), 343(9 to 12), 351(3 to 9), 359(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(331: 35.000000), (336: 25.000000), (359: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(328: 1), (331: 3), (336: 2), (337: 1), (341: 2), (343: 1), (351: 3), (359: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

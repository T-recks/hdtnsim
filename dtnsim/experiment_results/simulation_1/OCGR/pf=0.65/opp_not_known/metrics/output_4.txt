The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1770(10 to 6), 1786(1 to 11), 1789(1 to 6), 1790(5 to 10), 1820(4 to 1), 1825(9 to 12), 1845(3 to 9), 1877(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1786: 55.000000), (1789: 15.000000), (1845: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1770: 1), (1786: 5), (1789: 3), (1790: 5), (1820: 2), (1825: 4), (1845: 5), (1877: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

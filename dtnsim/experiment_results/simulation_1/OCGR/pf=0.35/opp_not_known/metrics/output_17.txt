The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1054(10 to 6), 1069(1 to 11), 1075(1 to 6), 1076(5 to 10), 1104(4 to 1), 1105(9 to 12), 1129(3 to 9), 1162(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1054: 55.000000), (1069: 35.000000), (1105: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1054: 4), (1069: 3), (1075: 1), (1076: 4), (1104: 3), (1105: 4), (1129: 4), (1162: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

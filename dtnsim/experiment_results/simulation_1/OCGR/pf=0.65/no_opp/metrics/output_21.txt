The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
168(10 to 6), 170(1 to 11), 174(1 to 6), 175(5 to 10), 178(4 to 1), 179(9 to 12), 186(3 to 9), 188(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(168: 1), (170: 2), (174: 1), (175: 1), (178: 1), (179: 3), (186: 3), (188: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 170: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 186: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4:

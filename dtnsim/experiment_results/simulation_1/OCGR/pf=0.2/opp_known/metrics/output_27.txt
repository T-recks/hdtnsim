The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
852(10 to 6), 858(1 to 11), 864(1 to 6), 865(5 to 10), 883(4 to 1), 887(9 to 12), 900(3 to 9), 925(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(858: 35.000000), (864: 15.000000), (865: 35.000000), (887: 0.000000), (900: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(852: 1), (858: 3), (864: 3), (865: 3), (883: 3), (887: 3), (900: 4), (925: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

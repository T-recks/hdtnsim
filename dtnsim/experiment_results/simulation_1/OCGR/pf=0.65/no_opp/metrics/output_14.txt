The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
446(10 to 6), 448(1 to 11), 451(1 to 6), 452(5 to 10), 454(4 to 1), 455(9 to 12), 459(3 to 9), 463(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(463: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(446: 1), (448: 2), (451: 1), (452: 1), (454: 1), (455: 2), (459: 2), (463: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 448: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

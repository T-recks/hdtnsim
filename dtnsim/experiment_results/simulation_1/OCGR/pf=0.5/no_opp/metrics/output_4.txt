The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
473(10 to 6), 479(1 to 11), 484(1 to 6), 485(5 to 10), 489(4 to 1), 491(9 to 12), 501(3 to 9), 509(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(484: 25.000000), (491: 55.000000), (501: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(473: 5), (479: 3), (484: 2), (485: 1), (489: 3), (491: 4), (501: 4), (509: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

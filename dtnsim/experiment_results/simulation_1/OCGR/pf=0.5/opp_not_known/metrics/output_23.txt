The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1454(10 to 6), 1471(1 to 11), 1478(1 to 6), 1479(5 to 10), 1508(4 to 1), 1509(9 to 12), 1527(3 to 9), 1559(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1509: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1454: 1), (1471: 2), (1478: 1), (1479: 5), (1508: 4), (1509: 3), (1527: 2), (1559: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

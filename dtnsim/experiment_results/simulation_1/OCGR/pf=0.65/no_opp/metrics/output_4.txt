The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
397(10 to 6), 401(1 to 11), 404(1 to 6), 405(5 to 10), 409(4 to 1), 411(9 to 12), 419(3 to 9), 425(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(404: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(397: 1), (401: 3), (404: 2), (405: 1), (409: 2), (411: 2), (419: 3), (425: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
372(10 to 6), 375(1 to 11), 380(1 to 6), 381(5 to 10), 384(4 to 1), 387(9 to 12), 393(3 to 9), 396(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(380: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(372: 1), (375: 3), (380: 2), (381: 1), (384: 1), (387: 1), (393: 2), (396: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 375: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 380: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 375: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 380: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 393: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 384: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 381: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 387: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10:

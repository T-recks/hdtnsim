The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
351(10 to 6), 357(1 to 11), 363(1 to 6), 364(5 to 10), 370(4 to 1), 372(9 to 12), 382(3 to 9), 390(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(357: 35.000000), (363: 65.000000), (364: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(351: 1), (357: 3), (363: 3), (364: 3), (370: 1), (372: 2), (382: 2), (390: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:

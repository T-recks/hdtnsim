The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
227(10 to 6), 245(1 to 11), 254(1 to 6), 255(5 to 10), 284(4 to 1), 290(9 to 12), 316(3 to 9), 349(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(227: 45.000000), (245: 35.000000), (254: 15.000000), (255: 35.000000), (290: 0.000000), (316: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(227: 4), (245: 3), (254: 3), (255: 3), (284: 4), (290: 3), (316: 4), (349: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1795(10 to 6), 1810(1 to 11), 1814(1 to 6), 1815(5 to 10), 1844(4 to 1), 1848(9 to 12), 1871(3 to 9), 1903(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1810: 35.000000), (1814: 15.000000), (1815: 35.000000), (1848: 0.000000), (1871: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1795: 1), (1810: 3), (1814: 3), (1815: 3), (1844: 2), (1848: 3), (1871: 5), (1903: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

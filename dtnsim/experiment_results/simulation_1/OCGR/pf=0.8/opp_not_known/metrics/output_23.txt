The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1360(10 to 6), 1373(1 to 11), 1375(1 to 6), 1376(5 to 10), 1405(4 to 1), 1406(9 to 12), 1424(3 to 9), 1452(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1406: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1360: 1), (1373: 2), (1375: 1), (1376: 4), (1405: 4), (1406: 3), (1424: 2), (1452: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1373: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

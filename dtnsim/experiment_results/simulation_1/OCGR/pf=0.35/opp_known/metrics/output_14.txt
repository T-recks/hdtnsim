The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1454(10 to 6), 1458(1 to 11), 1463(1 to 6), 1464(5 to 10), 1480(4 to 1), 1481(9 to 12), 1492(3 to 9), 1515(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1458: 35.000000), (1464: 35.000000), (1492: 15.000000), (1515: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1454: 1), (1458: 3), (1463: 1), (1464: 3), (1480: 2), (1481: 4), (1492: 4), (1515: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

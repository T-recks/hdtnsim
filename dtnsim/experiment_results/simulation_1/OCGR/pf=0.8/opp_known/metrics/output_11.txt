The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
452(10 to 6), 454(1 to 11), 457(1 to 6), 458(5 to 10), 473(4 to 1), 474(9 to 12), 477(3 to 9), 502(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(477: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(452: 1), (454: 2), (457: 1), (458: 5), (473: 2), (474: 4), (477: 6), (502: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

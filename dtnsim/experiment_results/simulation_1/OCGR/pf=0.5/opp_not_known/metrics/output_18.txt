The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1438(10 to 6), 1453(1 to 11), 1457(1 to 6), 1458(5 to 10), 1487(4 to 1), 1488(9 to 12), 1509(3 to 9), 1541(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1487: 60.000000), (1488: 0.000000), (1541: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1438: 1), (1453: 2), (1457: 1), (1458: 4), (1487: 4), (1488: 3), (1509: 4), (1541: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

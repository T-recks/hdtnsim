The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1346(10 to 6), 1348(1 to 11), 1351(1 to 6), 1352(5 to 10), 1368(4 to 1), 1370(9 to 12), 1375(3 to 9), 1395(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1375: 55.000000), (1395: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1346: 1), (1348: 2), (1351: 1), (1352: 5), (1368: 6), (1370: 4), (1375: 7), (1395: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
591(10 to 6), 605(1 to 11), 608(1 to 6), 609(5 to 10), 637(4 to 1), 639(9 to 12), 656(3 to 9), 684(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(591: 3), (605: 2), (608: 1), (609: 5), (637: 4), (639: 4), (656: 2), (684: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1510(10 to 6), 1517(1 to 11), 1525(1 to 6), 1526(5 to 10), 1543(4 to 1), 1546(9 to 12), 1560(3 to 9), 1584(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1510: 45.000000), (1517: 35.000000), (1526: 35.000000), (1543: 60.000000), (1546: 0.000000), (1560: 15.000000), (1584: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1510: 4), (1517: 3), (1525: 1), (1526: 3), (1543: 4), (1546: 3), (1560: 4), (1584: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

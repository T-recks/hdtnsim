The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
630(10 to 6), 636(1 to 11), 642(1 to 6), 643(5 to 10), 648(4 to 1), 650(9 to 12), 663(3 to 9), 675(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(630: 105.000000), (636: 35.000000), (642: 25.000000), (643: 35.000000), (648: 60.000000), (650: 55.000000), (663: 65.000000), (675: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(630: 5), (636: 3), (642: 2), (643: 3), (648: 4), (650: 4), (663: 4), (675: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

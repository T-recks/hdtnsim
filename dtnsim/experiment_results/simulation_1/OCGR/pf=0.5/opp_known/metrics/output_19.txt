The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1361(10 to 6), 1364(1 to 11), 1370(1 to 6), 1371(5 to 10), 1387(4 to 1), 1388(9 to 12), 1399(3 to 9), 1416(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1364: 35.000000), (1388: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1361: 1), (1364: 3), (1370: 1), (1371: 4), (1387: 4), (1388: 3), (1399: 2), (1416: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

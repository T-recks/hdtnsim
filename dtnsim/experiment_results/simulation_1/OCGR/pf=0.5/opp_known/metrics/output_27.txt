The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
774(10 to 6), 777(1 to 11), 780(1 to 6), 781(5 to 10), 798(4 to 1), 803(9 to 12), 813(3 to 9), 837(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(777: 35.000000), (780: 15.000000), (781: 35.000000), (803: 0.000000), (813: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(774: 1), (777: 4), (780: 3), (781: 3), (798: 3), (803: 3), (813: 4), (837: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

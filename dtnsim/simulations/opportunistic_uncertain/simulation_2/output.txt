The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(1 to 12), 269(8 to 2), 277(6 to 3), 281(4 to 5), 304(9 to 10), 305(12 to 11), 326(5 to 3), 358(2 to 4), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 45.000000), (269: 60.000000), (277: 10.000000), (281: 5.000000), (304: 21.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 4), (269: 12), (277: 3), (281: 8), (304: 6), (305: 8), (326: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 38 calls to RUCoP, which took 189 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
313(10 to 6), 317(1 to 11), 322(1 to 6), 323(5 to 10), 328(4 to 1), 330(9 to 12), 335(3 to 9), 340(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(322: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(313: 1), (317: 2), (322: 3), (323: 1), (328: 1), (330: 2), (335: 4), (340: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 317: (to: 3, time: 20.000000),

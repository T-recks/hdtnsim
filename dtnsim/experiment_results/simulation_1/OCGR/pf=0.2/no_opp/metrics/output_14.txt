The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
626(10 to 6), 633(1 to 11), 641(1 to 6), 642(5 to 10), 647(4 to 1), 650(9 to 12), 663(3 to 9), 674(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(626: 45.000000), (633: 35.000000), (642: 35.000000), (647: 60.000000), (650: 55.000000), (674: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(626: 4), (633: 3), (641: 1), (642: 3), (647: 4), (650: 4), (663: 4), (674: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

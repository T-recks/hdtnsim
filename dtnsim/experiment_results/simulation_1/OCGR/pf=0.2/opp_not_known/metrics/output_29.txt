The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1987(10 to 6), 2004(1 to 11), 2012(1 to 6), 2013(5 to 10), 2042(4 to 1), 2047(9 to 12), 2073(3 to 9), 2108(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1987: 105.000000), (2004: 35.000000), (2012: 15.000000), (2013: 35.000000), (2047: 0.000000), (2073: 55.000000), (2108: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1987: 5), (2004: 3), (2012: 3), (2013: 3), (2042: 2), (2047: 3), (2073: 5), (2108: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

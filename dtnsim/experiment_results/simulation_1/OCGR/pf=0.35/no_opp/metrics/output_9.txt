The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
576(10 to 6), 580(1 to 11), 583(1 to 6), 584(5 to 10), 588(4 to 1), 589(9 to 12), 598(3 to 9), 602(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(576: 3), (580: 2), (583: 1), (584: 1), (588: 1), (589: 3), (598: 2), (602: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 580: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1847(10 to 6), 1862(1 to 11), 1867(1 to 6), 1868(5 to 10), 1897(4 to 1), 1901(9 to 12), 1924(3 to 9), 1957(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1862: 35.000000), (1867: 15.000000), (1868: 35.000000), (1901: 0.000000), (1924: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1847: 1), (1862: 3), (1867: 3), (1868: 3), (1897: 2), (1901: 3), (1924: 5), (1957: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1945(10 to 6), 1961(1 to 11), 1964(1 to 6), 1965(5 to 10), 1995(4 to 1), 1997(9 to 12), 2021(3 to 9), 2052(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1965: 35.000000), (1997: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1945: 3), (1961: 2), (1964: 1), (1965: 7), (1995: 6), (1997: 3), (2021: 2), (2052: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

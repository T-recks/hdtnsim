The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
638(10 to 6), 654(1 to 11), 661(1 to 6), 662(5 to 10), 691(4 to 1), 696(9 to 12), 717(3 to 9), 746(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(661: 15.000000), (662: 55.000000), (696: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(638: 5), (654: 2), (661: 3), (662: 4), (691: 2), (696: 3), (717: 2), (746: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1060(10 to 6), 1077(1 to 11), 1082(1 to 6), 1083(5 to 10), 1113(4 to 1), 1117(9 to 12), 1141(3 to 9), 1176(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1077: 35.000000), (1082: 15.000000), (1083: 35.000000), (1117: 0.000000), (1141: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1060: 1), (1077: 3), (1082: 3), (1083: 3), (1113: 3), (1117: 3), (1141: 4), (1176: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
486(10 to 6), 489(1 to 11), 495(1 to 6), 496(5 to 10), 500(4 to 1), 501(9 to 12), 509(3 to 9), 512(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(489: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(486: 1), (489: 3), (495: 1), (496: 4), (500: 1), (501: 1), (509: 2), (512: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 489: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 495: (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

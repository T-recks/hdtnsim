The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
636(10 to 6), 651(1 to 11), 654(1 to 6), 655(5 to 10), 683(4 to 1), 684(9 to 12), 704(3 to 9), 735(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(683: 60.000000), (684: 55.000000), (704: 65.000000), (735: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(636: 1), (651: 2), (654: 1), (655: 4), (683: 4), (684: 4), (704: 4), (735: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(10 to 6), 219(1 to 11), 225(1 to 6), 226(5 to 10), 242(4 to 1), 243(9 to 12), 255(3 to 9), 276(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(213: 55.000000), (226: 35.000000), (242: 140.000000), (276: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 4), (219: 2), (225: 1), (226: 3), (242: 6), (243: 4), (255: 2), (276: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

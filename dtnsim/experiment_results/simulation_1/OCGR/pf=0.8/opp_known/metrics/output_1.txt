The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
461(10 to 6), 463(1 to 11), 466(1 to 6), 467(5 to 10), 483(4 to 1), 485(9 to 12), 490(3 to 9), 508(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(490: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(461: 3), (463: 2), (466: 1), (467: 5), (483: 4), (485: 4), (490: 7), (508: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

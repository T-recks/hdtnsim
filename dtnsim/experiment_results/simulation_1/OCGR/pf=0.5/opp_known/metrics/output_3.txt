The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1080(10 to 6), 1083(1 to 11), 1088(1 to 6), 1089(5 to 10), 1106(4 to 1), 1111(9 to 12), 1118(3 to 9), 1137(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1088: 15.000000), (1118: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1080: 1), (1083: 4), (1088: 3), (1089: 4), (1106: 4), (1111: 4), (1118: 7), (1137: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

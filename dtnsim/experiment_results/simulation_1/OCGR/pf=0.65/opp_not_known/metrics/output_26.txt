The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
592(10 to 6), 607(1 to 11), 610(1 to 6), 611(5 to 10), 639(4 to 1), 644(9 to 12), 662(3 to 9), 692(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(610: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(592: 4), (607: 3), (610: 3), (611: 4), (639: 2), (644: 4), (662: 2), (692: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

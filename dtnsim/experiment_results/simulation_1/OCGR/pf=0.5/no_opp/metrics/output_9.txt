The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
473(10 to 6), 476(1 to 11), 479(1 to 6), 480(5 to 10), 483(4 to 1), 484(9 to 12), 488(3 to 9), 491(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(473: 3), (476: 2), (479: 1), (480: 1), (483: 1), (484: 1), (488: 2), (491: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

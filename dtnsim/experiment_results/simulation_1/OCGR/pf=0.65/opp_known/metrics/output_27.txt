The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
744(10 to 6), 747(1 to 11), 750(1 to 6), 751(5 to 10), 768(4 to 1), 773(9 to 12), 783(3 to 9), 804(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(747: 35.000000), (750: 15.000000), (751: 35.000000), (773: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(744: 1), (747: 4), (750: 3), (751: 3), (768: 4), (773: 3), (783: 2), (804: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
374(10 to 6), 380(1 to 11), 387(1 to 6), 388(5 to 10), 394(4 to 1), 396(9 to 12), 408(3 to 9), 420(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(374: 105.000000), (380: 35.000000), (387: 25.000000), (388: 35.000000), (394: 60.000000), (396: 55.000000), (408: 65.000000), (420: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(374: 5), (380: 3), (387: 2), (388: 3), (394: 4), (396: 4), (408: 4), (420: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
81(10 to 6), 87(1 to 11), 93(1 to 6), 94(5 to 10), 98(4 to 1), 99(9 to 12), 111(3 to 9), 118(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(81: 55.000000), (94: 35.000000), (118: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(81: 4), (87: 2), (93: 1), (94: 3), (98: 1), (99: 3), (111: 2), (118: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 87: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1109(10 to 6), 1125(1 to 11), 1132(1 to 6), 1133(5 to 10), 1161(4 to 1), 1162(9 to 12), 1187(3 to 9), 1221(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1109: 55.000000), (1125: 35.000000), (1162: 55.000000), (1187: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1109: 4), (1125: 3), (1132: 1), (1133: 4), (1161: 3), (1162: 4), (1187: 4), (1221: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

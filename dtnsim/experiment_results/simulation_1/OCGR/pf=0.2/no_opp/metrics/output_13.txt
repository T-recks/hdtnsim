The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
474(10 to 6), 481(1 to 11), 489(1 to 6), 490(5 to 10), 495(4 to 1), 498(9 to 12), 512(3 to 9), 524(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(474: 105.000000), (481: 35.000000), (489: 25.000000), (490: 35.000000), (498: 55.000000), (512: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(474: 5), (481: 3), (489: 2), (490: 3), (495: 4), (498: 4), (512: 4), (524: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

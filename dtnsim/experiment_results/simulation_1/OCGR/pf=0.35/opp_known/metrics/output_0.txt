The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(10 to 6), 219(1 to 11), 226(1 to 6), 227(5 to 10), 245(4 to 1), 249(9 to 12), 261(3 to 9), 282(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(219: 35.000000), (226: 15.000000), (227: 35.000000), (245: 140.000000), (249: 0.000000), (282: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 1), (219: 3), (226: 3), (227: 3), (245: 6), (249: 3), (261: 2), (282: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

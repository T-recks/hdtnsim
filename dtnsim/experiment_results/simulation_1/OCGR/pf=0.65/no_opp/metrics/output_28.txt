The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
337(10 to 6), 339(1 to 11), 343(1 to 6), 344(5 to 10), 347(4 to 1), 348(9 to 12), 352(3 to 9), 356(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(337: 1), (339: 2), (343: 1), (344: 2), (347: 4), (348: 1), (352: 2), (356: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

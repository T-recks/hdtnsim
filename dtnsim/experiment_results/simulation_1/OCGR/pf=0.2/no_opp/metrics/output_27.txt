The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
355(10 to 6), 361(1 to 11), 367(1 to 6), 368(5 to 10), 374(4 to 1), 376(9 to 12), 389(3 to 9), 401(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(361: 35.000000), (367: 25.000000), (368: 35.000000), (376: 55.000000), (389: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(355: 1), (361: 3), (367: 2), (368: 3), (374: 3), (376: 4), (389: 4), (401: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1406(10 to 6), 1421(1 to 11), 1424(1 to 6), 1425(5 to 10), 1453(4 to 1), 1454(9 to 12), 1471(3 to 9), 1500(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1454: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1406: 1), (1421: 2), (1424: 1), (1425: 4), (1453: 4), (1454: 4), (1471: 2), (1500: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
494(10 to 6), 496(1 to 11), 500(1 to 6), 501(5 to 10), 518(4 to 1), 520(9 to 12), 530(3 to 9), 548(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(501: 55.000000), (520: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(494: 1), (496: 2), (500: 1), (501: 8), (518: 5), (520: 3), (530: 5), (548: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

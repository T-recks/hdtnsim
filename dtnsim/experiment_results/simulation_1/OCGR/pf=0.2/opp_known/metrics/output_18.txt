The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1173(10 to 6), 1179(1 to 11), 1187(1 to 6), 1188(5 to 10), 1204(4 to 1), 1207(9 to 12), 1221(3 to 9), 1244(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1173: 45.000000), (1179: 35.000000), (1188: 35.000000), (1204: 60.000000), (1207: 0.000000), (1221: 15.000000), (1244: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1173: 4), (1179: 3), (1187: 1), (1188: 3), (1204: 4), (1207: 3), (1221: 4), (1244: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

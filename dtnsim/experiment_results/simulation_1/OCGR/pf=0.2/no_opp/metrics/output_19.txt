The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
622(10 to 6), 626(1 to 11), 633(1 to 6), 634(5 to 10), 639(4 to 1), 640(9 to 12), 653(3 to 9), 659(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(626: 35.000000), (634: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(622: 1), (626: 3), (633: 1), (634: 3), (639: 1), (640: 3), (653: 2), (659: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 626: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 633: (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

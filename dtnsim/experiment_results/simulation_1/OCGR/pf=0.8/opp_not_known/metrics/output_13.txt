The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1350(10 to 6), 1365(1 to 11), 1367(1 to 6), 1368(5 to 10), 1396(4 to 1), 1400(9 to 12), 1417(3 to 9), 1446(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1367: 15.000000), (1400: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1350: 1), (1365: 2), (1367: 3), (1368: 4), (1396: 4), (1400: 4), (1417: 2), (1446: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

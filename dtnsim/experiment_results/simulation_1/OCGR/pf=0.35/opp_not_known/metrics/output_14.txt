The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1934(10 to 6), 1950(1 to 11), 1955(1 to 6), 1956(5 to 10), 1984(4 to 1), 1985(9 to 12), 2008(3 to 9), 2041(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1950: 35.000000), (1956: 35.000000), (2008: 55.000000), (2041: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1934: 1), (1950: 3), (1955: 1), (1956: 3), (1984: 2), (1985: 4), (2008: 5), (2041: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

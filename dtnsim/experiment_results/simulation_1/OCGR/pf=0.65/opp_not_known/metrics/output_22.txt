The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1020(10 to 6), 1034(1 to 11), 1037(1 to 6), 1038(5 to 10), 1068(4 to 1), 1074(9 to 12), 1091(3 to 9), 1121(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1037: 15.000000), (1091: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1020: 1), (1034: 3), (1037: 3), (1038: 5), (1068: 6), (1074: 4), (1091: 6), (1121: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

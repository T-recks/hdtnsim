The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1085(10 to 6), 1100(1 to 11), 1105(1 to 6), 1106(5 to 10), 1136(4 to 1), 1140(9 to 12), 1162(3 to 9), 1194(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1100: 35.000000), (1105: 15.000000), (1140: 0.000000), (1162: 55.000000), (1194: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1085: 1), (1100: 3), (1105: 3), (1106: 4), (1136: 2), (1140: 3), (1162: 5), (1194: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

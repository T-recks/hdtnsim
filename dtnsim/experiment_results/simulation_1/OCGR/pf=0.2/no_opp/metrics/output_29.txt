The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
628(10 to 6), 633(1 to 11), 641(1 to 6), 642(5 to 10), 647(4 to 1), 650(9 to 12), 664(3 to 9), 676(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(628: 105.000000), (633: 35.000000), (641: 25.000000), (642: 35.000000), (676: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(628: 5), (633: 3), (641: 2), (642: 3), (647: 2), (650: 4), (664: 3), (676: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

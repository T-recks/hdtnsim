The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1364(10 to 6), 1379(1 to 11), 1382(1 to 6), 1383(5 to 10), 1410(4 to 1), 1411(9 to 12), 1428(3 to 9), 1456(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1364: 1), (1379: 2), (1382: 1), (1383: 4), (1410: 4), (1411: 4), (1428: 2), (1456: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

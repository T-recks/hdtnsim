The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
834(10 to 6), 837(1 to 11), 842(1 to 6), 843(5 to 10), 861(4 to 1), 865(9 to 12), 875(3 to 9), 897(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(837: 35.000000), (842: 15.000000), (865: 0.000000), (875: 15.000000), (897: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(834: 1), (837: 3), (842: 3), (843: 4), (861: 2), (865: 3), (875: 4), (897: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
471(10 to 6), 472(1 to 11), 474(1 to 6), 475(5 to 10), 491(4 to 1), 492(9 to 12), 497(3 to 9), 518(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(497: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(471: 1), (472: 2), (474: 1), (475: 4), (491: 2), (492: 4), (497: 4), (518: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

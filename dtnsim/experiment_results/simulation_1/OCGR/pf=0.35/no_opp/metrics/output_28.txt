The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
437(10 to 6), 440(1 to 11), 447(1 to 6), 448(5 to 10), 452(4 to 1), 455(9 to 12), 461(3 to 9), 467(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(447: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(437: 1), (440: 3), (447: 2), (448: 2), (452: 4), (455: 1), (461: 2), (467: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 440: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

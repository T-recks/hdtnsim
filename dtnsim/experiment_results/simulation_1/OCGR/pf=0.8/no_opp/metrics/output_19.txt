The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
345(10 to 6), 347(1 to 11), 350(1 to 6), 351(5 to 10), 353(4 to 1), 354(9 to 12), 356(3 to 9), 357(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(345: 1), (347: 2), (350: 1), (351: 2), (353: 1), (354: 1), (356: 2), (357: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 347: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

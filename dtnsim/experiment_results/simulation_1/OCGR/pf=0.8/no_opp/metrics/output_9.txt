The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
364(10 to 6), 366(1 to 11), 367(1 to 6), 368(5 to 10), 371(4 to 1), 372(9 to 12), 373(3 to 9), 376(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(364: 1), (366: 2), (367: 1), (368: 1), (371: 1), (372: 1), (373: 2), (376: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 366: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 367: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 373: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 371: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 368: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 372: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 364: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12:

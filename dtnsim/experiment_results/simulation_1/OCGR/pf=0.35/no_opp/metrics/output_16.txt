The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
186(10 to 6), 189(1 to 11), 192(1 to 6), 193(5 to 10), 195(4 to 1), 196(9 to 12), 202(3 to 9), 209(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(195: 60.000000), (202: 65.000000), (209: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(186: 1), (189: 2), (192: 1), (193: 1), (195: 4), (196: 1), (202: 4), (209: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

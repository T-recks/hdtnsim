The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
751(10 to 6), 753(1 to 11), 755(1 to 6), 756(5 to 10), 771(4 to 1), 772(9 to 12), 777(3 to 9), 795(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(753: 65.000000), (771: 140.000000), (772: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(751: 1), (753: 5), (755: 1), (756: 4), (771: 6), (772: 4), (777: 5), (795: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

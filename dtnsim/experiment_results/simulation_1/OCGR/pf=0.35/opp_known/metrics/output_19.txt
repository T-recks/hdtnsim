The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1412(10 to 6), 1415(1 to 11), 1421(1 to 6), 1422(5 to 10), 1439(4 to 1), 1440(9 to 12), 1453(3 to 9), 1472(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1415: 35.000000), (1422: 35.000000), (1439: 140.000000), (1440: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1412: 1), (1415: 3), (1421: 1), (1422: 3), (1439: 6), (1440: 3), (1453: 2), (1472: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

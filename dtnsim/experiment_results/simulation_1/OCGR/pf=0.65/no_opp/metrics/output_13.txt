The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
350(10 to 6), 355(1 to 11), 358(1 to 6), 359(5 to 10), 361(4 to 1), 363(9 to 12), 368(3 to 9), 374(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(358: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(350: 1), (355: 2), (358: 2), (359: 1), (361: 4), (363: 1), (368: 3), (374: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

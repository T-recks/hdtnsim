The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1846(10 to 6), 1864(1 to 11), 1869(1 to 6), 1870(5 to 10), 1900(4 to 1), 1905(9 to 12), 1927(3 to 9), 1962(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1864: 55.000000), (1869: 15.000000), (1905: 55.000000), (1927: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1846: 5), (1864: 5), (1869: 3), (1870: 9), (1900: 3), (1905: 4), (1927: 4), (1962: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

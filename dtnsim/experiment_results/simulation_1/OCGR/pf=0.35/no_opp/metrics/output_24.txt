The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
552(10 to 6), 558(1 to 11), 562(1 to 6), 563(5 to 10), 566(4 to 1), 567(9 to 12), 572(3 to 9), 583(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(552: 105.000000), (572: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(552: 5), (558: 2), (562: 1), (563: 1), (566: 4), (567: 1), (572: 4), (583: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

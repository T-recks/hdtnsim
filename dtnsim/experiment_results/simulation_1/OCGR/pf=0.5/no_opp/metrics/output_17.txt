The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
274(10 to 6), 276(1 to 11), 281(1 to 6), 282(5 to 10), 284(4 to 1), 285(9 to 12), 294(3 to 9), 302(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(276: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(274: 1), (276: 3), (281: 1), (282: 1), (284: 3), (285: 1), (294: 4), (302: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

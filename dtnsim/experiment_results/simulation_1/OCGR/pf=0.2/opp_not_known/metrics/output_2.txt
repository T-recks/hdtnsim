The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1117(10 to 6), 1134(1 to 11), 1140(1 to 6), 1141(5 to 10), 1169(4 to 1), 1173(9 to 12), 1198(3 to 9), 1232(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1134: 35.000000), (1140: 15.000000), (1141: 35.000000), (1169: 140.000000), (1173: 0.000000), (1232: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1117: 1), (1134: 3), (1140: 3), (1141: 3), (1169: 6), (1173: 3), (1198: 2), (1232: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

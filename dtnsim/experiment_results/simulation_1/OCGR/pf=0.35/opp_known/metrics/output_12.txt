The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
828(10 to 6), 831(1 to 11), 835(1 to 6), 836(5 to 10), 854(4 to 1), 859(9 to 12), 871(3 to 9), 892(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(831: 35.000000), (835: 15.000000), (836: 35.000000), (854: 140.000000), (859: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(828: 3), (831: 4), (835: 3), (836: 3), (854: 6), (859: 3), (871: 2), (892: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

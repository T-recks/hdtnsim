The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
143(10 to 6), 145(1 to 11), 148(1 to 6), 149(5 to 10), 151(4 to 1), 152(9 to 12), 156(3 to 9), 158(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(143: 3), (145: 2), (148: 1), (149: 1), (151: 1), (152: 2), (156: 2), (158: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 145: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

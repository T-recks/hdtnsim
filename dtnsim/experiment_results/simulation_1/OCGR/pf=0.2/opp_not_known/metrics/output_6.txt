The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
676(10 to 6), 693(1 to 11), 701(1 to 6), 702(5 to 10), 731(4 to 1), 734(9 to 12), 757(3 to 9), 792(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(676: 45.000000), (702: 35.000000), (731: 60.000000), (734: 0.000000), (792: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(676: 4), (693: 2), (701: 1), (702: 3), (731: 4), (734: 3), (757: 4), (792: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1934(10 to 6), 1952(1 to 11), 1957(1 to 6), 1958(5 to 10), 1988(4 to 1), 1993(9 to 12), 2018(3 to 9), 2050(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1934: 105.000000), (1952: 35.000000), (1957: 15.000000), (1988: 60.000000), (1993: 55.000000), (2018: 65.000000), (2050: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1934: 5), (1952: 3), (1957: 3), (1958: 8), (1988: 4), (1993: 4), (2018: 4), (2050: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

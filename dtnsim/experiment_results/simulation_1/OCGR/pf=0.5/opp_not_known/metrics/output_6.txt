The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
629(10 to 6), 645(1 to 11), 648(1 to 6), 649(5 to 10), 679(4 to 1), 681(9 to 12), 701(3 to 9), 738(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(649: 55.000000), (681: 0.000000), (701: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(629: 4), (645: 2), (648: 1), (649: 9), (679: 2), (681: 3), (701: 5), (738: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

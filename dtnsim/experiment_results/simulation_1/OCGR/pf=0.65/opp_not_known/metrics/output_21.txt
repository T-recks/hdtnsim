The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
618(10 to 6), 632(1 to 11), 636(1 to 6), 637(5 to 10), 666(4 to 1), 668(9 to 12), 690(3 to 9), 718(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(637: 55.000000), (668: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(618: 1), (632: 2), (636: 1), (637: 8), (666: 5), (668: 3), (690: 3), (718: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

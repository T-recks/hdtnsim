The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
427(10 to 6), 433(1 to 11), 442(1 to 6), 443(5 to 10), 448(4 to 1), 451(9 to 12), 456(3 to 9), 461(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(427: 45.000000), (456: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(427: 4), (433: 2), (442: 1), (443: 2), (448: 1), (451: 3), (456: 5), (461: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

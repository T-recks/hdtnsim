The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
777(10 to 6), 779(1 to 11), 784(1 to 6), 785(5 to 10), 801(4 to 1), 802(9 to 12), 813(3 to 9), 835(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(779: 35.000000), (802: 55.000000), (813: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(777: 1), (779: 3), (784: 1), (785: 4), (801: 3), (802: 4), (813: 4), (835: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1000(10 to 6), 1003(1 to 11), 1006(1 to 6), 1007(5 to 10), 1022(4 to 1), 1023(9 to 12), 1028(3 to 9), 1046(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1028: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1000: 1), (1003: 2), (1006: 1), (1007: 4), (1022: 4), (1023: 4), (1028: 7), (1046: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

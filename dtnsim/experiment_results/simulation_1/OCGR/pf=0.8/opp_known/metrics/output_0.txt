The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
193(10 to 6), 195(1 to 11), 200(1 to 6), 201(5 to 10), 215(4 to 1), 216(9 to 12), 223(3 to 9), 243(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(201: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(193: 1), (195: 3), (200: 1), (201: 3), (215: 4), (216: 4), (223: 5), (243: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
612(10 to 6), 628(1 to 11), 633(1 to 6), 634(5 to 10), 663(4 to 1), 667(9 to 12), 687(3 to 9), 717(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(633: 15.000000), (634: 55.000000), (667: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(612: 4), (628: 2), (633: 3), (634: 4), (663: 2), (667: 3), (687: 2), (717: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

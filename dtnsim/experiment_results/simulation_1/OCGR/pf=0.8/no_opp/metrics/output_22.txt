The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
213(10 to 6), 215(1 to 11), 216(1 to 6), 217(5 to 10), 220(4 to 1), 223(9 to 12), 225(3 to 9), 227(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(216: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(213: 1), (215: 3), (216: 3), (217: 1), (220: 1), (223: 1), (225: 4), (227: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 215: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 216: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 215: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 216: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Bundle 225: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 220: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 217: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Bundle 225: (to: 12, time: 110.000000),

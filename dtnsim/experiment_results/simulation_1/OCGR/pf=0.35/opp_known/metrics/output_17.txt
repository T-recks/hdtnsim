The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
806(10 to 6), 809(1 to 11), 815(1 to 6), 816(5 to 10), 832(4 to 1), 833(9 to 12), 845(3 to 9), 868(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(806: 55.000000), (809: 35.000000), (833: 55.000000), (845: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(806: 4), (809: 3), (815: 1), (816: 4), (832: 3), (833: 4), (845: 4), (868: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

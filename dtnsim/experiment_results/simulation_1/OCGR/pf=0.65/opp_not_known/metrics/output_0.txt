The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(10 to 6), 222(1 to 11), 228(1 to 6), 229(5 to 10), 255(4 to 1), 256(9 to 12), 275(3 to 9), 305(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(229: 35.000000), (255: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 1), (222: 2), (228: 1), (229: 3), (255: 6), (256: 4), (275: 2), (305: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

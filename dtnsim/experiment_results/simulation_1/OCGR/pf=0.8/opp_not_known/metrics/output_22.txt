The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
972(10 to 6), 986(1 to 11), 987(1 to 6), 988(5 to 10), 1017(4 to 1), 1022(9 to 12), 1038(3 to 9), 1066(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(987: 15.000000), (1038: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(972: 1), (986: 3), (987: 3), (988: 4), (1017: 4), (1022: 4), (1038: 6), (1066: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 41 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
777(10 to 6), 779(1 to 11), 782(1 to 6), 783(5 to 10), 801(4 to 1), 807(9 to 12), 812(3 to 9), 835(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(782: 15.000000), (812: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(777: 1), (779: 4), (782: 3), (783: 5), (801: 6), (807: 4), (812: 6), (835: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

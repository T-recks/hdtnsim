The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
61(10 to 6), 65(1 to 11), 69(1 to 6), 70(5 to 10), 73(4 to 1), 75(9 to 12), 79(3 to 9), 81(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(61: 1), (65: 2), (69: 3), (70: 1), (73: 1), (75: 2), (79: 2), (81: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 65: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 69: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 65: (to: 4, time: 60.000000),

Bundle 79: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 73: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 70: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Bundle 75: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 9:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1543(10 to 6), 1561(1 to 11), 1570(1 to 6), 1571(5 to 10), 1601(4 to 1), 1607(9 to 12), 1627(3 to 9), 1661(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1543: 45.000000), (1570: 15.000000), (1571: 55.000000), (1607: 0.000000), (1627: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1543: 4), (1561: 2), (1570: 3), (1571: 5), (1601: 3), (1607: 3), (1627: 5), (1661: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
673(10 to 6), 690(1 to 11), 697(1 to 6), 698(5 to 10), 728(4 to 1), 735(9 to 12), 756(3 to 9), 788(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(673: 45.000000), (697: 15.000000), (698: 35.000000), (728: 60.000000), (735: 0.000000), (756: 65.000000), (788: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(673: 4), (690: 3), (697: 3), (698: 3), (728: 4), (735: 3), (756: 5), (788: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

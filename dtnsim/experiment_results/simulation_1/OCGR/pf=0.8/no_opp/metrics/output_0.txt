The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
61(10 to 6), 63(1 to 11), 68(1 to 6), 69(5 to 10), 71(4 to 1), 72(9 to 12), 77(3 to 9), 81(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(69: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(61: 1), (63: 2), (68: 1), (69: 3), (71: 1), (72: 1), (77: 2), (81: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 63: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 68: (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

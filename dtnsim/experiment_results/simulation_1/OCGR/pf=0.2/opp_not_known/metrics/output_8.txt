The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1572(10 to 6), 1590(1 to 11), 1598(1 to 6), 1599(5 to 10), 1628(4 to 1), 1632(9 to 12), 1658(3 to 9), 1692(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1590: 35.000000), (1598: 15.000000), (1599: 35.000000), (1628: 60.000000), (1632: 0.000000), (1658: 65.000000), (1692: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1572: 1), (1590: 3), (1598: 3), (1599: 3), (1628: 4), (1632: 3), (1658: 4), (1692: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

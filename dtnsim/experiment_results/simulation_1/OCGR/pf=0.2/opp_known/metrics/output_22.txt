The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
853(10 to 6), 859(1 to 11), 865(1 to 6), 866(5 to 10), 884(4 to 1), 888(9 to 12), 900(3 to 9), 922(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(859: 35.000000), (865: 15.000000), (866: 35.000000), (888: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(853: 1), (859: 3), (865: 3), (866: 3), (884: 6), (888: 3), (900: 2), (922: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

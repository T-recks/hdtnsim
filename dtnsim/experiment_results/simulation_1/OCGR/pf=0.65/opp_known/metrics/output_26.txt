The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
460(10 to 6), 463(1 to 11), 466(1 to 6), 467(5 to 10), 483(4 to 1), 488(9 to 12), 494(3 to 9), 514(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(463: 65.000000), (466: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(460: 4), (463: 6), (466: 3), (467: 4), (483: 2), (488: 4), (494: 5), (514: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

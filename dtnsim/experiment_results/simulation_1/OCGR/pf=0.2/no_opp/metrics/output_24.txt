The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
627(10 to 6), 634(1 to 11), 642(1 to 6), 643(5 to 10), 648(4 to 1), 652(9 to 12), 664(3 to 9), 675(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(627: 45.000000), (634: 35.000000), (642: 25.000000), (648: 60.000000), (652: 55.000000), (664: 65.000000), (675: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(627: 4), (634: 3), (642: 2), (643: 1), (648: 4), (652: 4), (664: 4), (675: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

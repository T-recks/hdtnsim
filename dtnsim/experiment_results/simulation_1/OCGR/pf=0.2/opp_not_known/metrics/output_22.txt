The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1105(10 to 6), 1123(1 to 11), 1129(1 to 6), 1130(5 to 10), 1160(4 to 1), 1164(9 to 12), 1188(3 to 9), 1222(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1123: 35.000000), (1129: 15.000000), (1130: 35.000000), (1164: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1105: 1), (1123: 3), (1129: 3), (1130: 3), (1160: 6), (1164: 3), (1188: 2), (1222: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

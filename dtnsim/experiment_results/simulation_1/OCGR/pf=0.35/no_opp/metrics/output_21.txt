The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
203(10 to 6), 206(1 to 11), 212(1 to 6), 213(5 to 10), 216(4 to 1), 218(9 to 12), 226(3 to 9), 230(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(203: 105.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(203: 5), (206: 2), (212: 1), (213: 1), (216: 1), (218: 3), (226: 3), (230: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 206: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

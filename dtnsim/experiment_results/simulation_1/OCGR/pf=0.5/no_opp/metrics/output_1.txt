The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
180(10 to 6), 182(1 to 11), 186(1 to 6), 187(5 to 10), 190(4 to 1), 191(9 to 12), 198(3 to 9), 205(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(191: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(180: 5), (182: 2), (186: 1), (187: 1), (190: 3), (191: 4), (198: 2), (205: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 182: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

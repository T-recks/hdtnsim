The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
401(10 to 6), 404(1 to 11), 409(1 to 6), 410(5 to 10), 412(4 to 1), 413(9 to 12), 418(3 to 9), 420(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(401: 1), (404: 3), (409: 1), (410: 2), (412: 1), (413: 1), (418: 2), (420: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 404: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 409: (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

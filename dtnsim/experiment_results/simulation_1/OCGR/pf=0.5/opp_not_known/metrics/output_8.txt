The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1453(10 to 6), 1469(1 to 11), 1474(1 to 6), 1475(5 to 10), 1504(4 to 1), 1509(9 to 12), 1528(3 to 9), 1558(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1474: 15.000000), (1475: 35.000000), (1509: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1453: 1), (1469: 3), (1474: 3), (1475: 3), (1504: 4), (1509: 3), (1528: 2), (1558: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

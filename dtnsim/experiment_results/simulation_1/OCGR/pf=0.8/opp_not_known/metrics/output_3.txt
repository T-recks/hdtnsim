The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1347(10 to 6), 1360(1 to 11), 1362(1 to 6), 1363(5 to 10), 1390(4 to 1), 1391(9 to 12), 1408(3 to 9), 1437(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1347: 1), (1360: 2), (1362: 1), (1363: 4), (1390: 4), (1391: 4), (1408: 2), (1437: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
354(10 to 6), 358(1 to 11), 362(1 to 6), 363(5 to 10), 367(4 to 1), 368(9 to 12), 373(3 to 9), 376(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(354: 1), (358: 2), (362: 1), (363: 1), (367: 1), (368: 3), (373: 2), (376: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 20 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

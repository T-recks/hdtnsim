The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
191(10 to 6), 195(1 to 11), 202(1 to 6), 203(5 to 10), 208(4 to 1), 211(9 to 12), 219(3 to 9), 224(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(202: 25.000000), (203: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(191: 5), (195: 2), (202: 2), (203: 4), (208: 2), (211: 2), (219: 2), (224: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

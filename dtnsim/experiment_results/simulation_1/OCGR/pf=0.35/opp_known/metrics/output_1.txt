The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
529(10 to 6), 534(1 to 11), 539(1 to 6), 540(5 to 10), 556(4 to 1), 557(9 to 12), 566(3 to 9), 592(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(529: 105.000000), (540: 35.000000), (556: 60.000000), (557: 0.000000), (566: 15.000000), (592: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(529: 5), (534: 2), (539: 1), (540: 3), (556: 4), (557: 3), (566: 6), (592: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

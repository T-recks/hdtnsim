The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1264(10 to 6), 1266(1 to 11), 1267(1 to 6), 1268(5 to 10), 1285(4 to 1), 1286(9 to 12), 1290(3 to 9), 1309(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1286: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1264: 1), (1266: 2), (1267: 1), (1268: 4), (1285: 4), (1286: 3), (1290: 5), (1309: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

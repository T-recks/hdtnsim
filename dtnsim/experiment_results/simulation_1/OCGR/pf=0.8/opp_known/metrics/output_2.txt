The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
724(10 to 6), 726(1 to 11), 728(1 to 6), 729(5 to 10), 744(4 to 1), 745(9 to 12), 749(3 to 9), 767(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(744: 140.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(724: 1), (726: 3), (728: 1), (729: 4), (744: 6), (745: 4), (749: 5), (767: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

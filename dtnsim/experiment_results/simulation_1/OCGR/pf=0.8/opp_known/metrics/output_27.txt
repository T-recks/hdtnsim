The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
706(10 to 6), 708(1 to 11), 710(1 to 6), 711(5 to 10), 728(4 to 1), 733(9 to 12), 740(3 to 9), 761(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(708: 55.000000), (710: 15.000000), (733: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(706: 1), (708: 6), (710: 3), (711: 4), (728: 4), (733: 3), (740: 2), (761: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

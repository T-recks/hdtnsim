The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
431(10 to 6), 434(1 to 11), 438(1 to 6), 439(5 to 10), 444(4 to 1), 446(9 to 12), 455(3 to 9), 463(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(434: 35.000000), (439: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(431: 1), (434: 3), (438: 3), (439: 3), (444: 2), (446: 2), (455: 3), (463: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:

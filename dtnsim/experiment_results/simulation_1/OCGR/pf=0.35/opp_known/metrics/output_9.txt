The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1454(10 to 6), 1458(1 to 11), 1461(1 to 6), 1462(5 to 10), 1480(4 to 1), 1482(9 to 12), 1494(3 to 9), 1513(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1462: 35.000000), (1482: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1454: 3), (1458: 2), (1461: 1), (1462: 7), (1480: 6), (1482: 3), (1494: 2), (1513: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
727(10 to 6), 729(1 to 11), 730(1 to 6), 731(5 to 10), 748(4 to 1), 753(9 to 12), 757(3 to 9), 778(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(730: 15.000000), (757: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(727: 1), (729: 4), (730: 3), (731: 4), (748: 4), (753: 4), (757: 6), (778: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

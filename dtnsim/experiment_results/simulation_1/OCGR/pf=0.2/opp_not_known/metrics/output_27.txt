The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1104(10 to 6), 1122(1 to 11), 1128(1 to 6), 1129(5 to 10), 1159(4 to 1), 1163(9 to 12), 1188(3 to 9), 1223(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1122: 35.000000), (1128: 15.000000), (1129: 35.000000), (1163: 0.000000), (1188: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1104: 1), (1122: 3), (1128: 3), (1129: 3), (1159: 3), (1163: 3), (1188: 4), (1223: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

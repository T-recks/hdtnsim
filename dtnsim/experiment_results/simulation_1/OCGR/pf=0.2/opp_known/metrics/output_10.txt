The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(10 to 6), 218(1 to 11), 224(1 to 6), 225(5 to 10), 243(4 to 1), 249(9 to 12), 261(3 to 9), 283(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 105.000000), (218: 65.000000), (224: 15.000000), (225: 35.000000), (243: 60.000000), (249: 0.000000), (283: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 5), (218: 5), (224: 3), (225: 7), (243: 4), (249: 3), (261: 5), (283: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 35 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1898(10 to 6), 1913(1 to 11), 1919(1 to 6), 1920(5 to 10), 1949(4 to 1), 1950(9 to 12), 1975(3 to 9), 2006(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1913: 35.000000), (1920: 35.000000), (1949: 140.000000), (1950: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1898: 1), (1913: 3), (1919: 1), (1920: 3), (1949: 6), (1950: 3), (1975: 2), (2006: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

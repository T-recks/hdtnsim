The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1438(10 to 6), 1453(1 to 11), 1458(1 to 6), 1459(5 to 10), 1488(4 to 1), 1493(9 to 12), 1512(3 to 9), 1541(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1458: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1438: 1), (1453: 3), (1458: 3), (1459: 4), (1488: 4), (1493: 4), (1512: 2), (1541: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 40 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1991(10 to 6), 2010(1 to 11), 2018(1 to 6), 2019(5 to 10), 2050(4 to 1), 2057(9 to 12), 2083(3 to 9), 2118(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1991: 45.000000), (2010: 35.000000), (2018: 15.000000), (2019: 35.000000), (2050: 60.000000), (2057: 0.000000), (2083: 65.000000), (2118: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1991: 4), (2010: 3), (2018: 3), (2019: 7), (2050: 4), (2057: 3), (2083: 4), (2118: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

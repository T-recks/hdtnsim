The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
541(10 to 6), 545(1 to 11), 553(1 to 6), 554(5 to 10), 570(4 to 1), 572(9 to 12), 584(3 to 9), 607(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(541: 105.000000), (554: 35.000000), (572: 0.000000), (584: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(541: 5), (545: 2), (553: 1), (554: 3), (570: 2), (572: 3), (584: 4), (607: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
790(10 to 6), 792(1 to 11), 796(1 to 6), 797(5 to 10), 814(4 to 1), 818(9 to 12), 826(3 to 9), 846(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(792: 55.000000), (796: 15.000000), (814: 140.000000), (818: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(790: 1), (792: 5), (796: 3), (797: 4), (814: 6), (818: 3), (826: 2), (846: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

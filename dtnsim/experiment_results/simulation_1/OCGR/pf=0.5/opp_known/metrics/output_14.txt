The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1411(10 to 6), 1414(1 to 11), 1418(1 to 6), 1419(5 to 10), 1435(4 to 1), 1436(9 to 12), 1443(3 to 9), 1464(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1419: 55.000000), (1435: 140.000000), (1464: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1411: 1), (1414: 2), (1418: 1), (1419: 5), (1435: 6), (1436: 4), (1443: 2), (1464: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

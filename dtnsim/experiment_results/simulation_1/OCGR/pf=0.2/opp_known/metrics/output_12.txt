The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
856(10 to 6), 860(1 to 11), 864(1 to 6), 865(5 to 10), 883(4 to 1), 888(9 to 12), 900(3 to 9), 921(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(860: 35.000000), (864: 15.000000), (865: 35.000000), (883: 140.000000), (888: 0.000000), (921: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(856: 3), (860: 4), (864: 3), (865: 3), (883: 6), (888: 3), (900: 2), (921: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

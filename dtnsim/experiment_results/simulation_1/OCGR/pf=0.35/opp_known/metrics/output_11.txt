The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
512(10 to 6), 516(1 to 11), 522(1 to 6), 523(5 to 10), 539(4 to 1), 544(9 to 12), 550(3 to 9), 576(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(512: 105.000000), (516: 65.000000), (522: 15.000000), (539: 60.000000), (544: 55.000000), (550: 15.000000), (576: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(512: 6), (516: 6), (522: 3), (523: 5), (539: 4), (544: 4), (550: 6), (576: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

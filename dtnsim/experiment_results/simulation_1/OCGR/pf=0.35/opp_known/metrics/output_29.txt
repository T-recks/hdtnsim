The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1438(10 to 6), 1441(1 to 11), 1447(1 to 6), 1448(5 to 10), 1465(4 to 1), 1469(9 to 12), 1481(3 to 9), 1505(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1441: 35.000000), (1447: 15.000000), (1448: 35.000000), (1469: 0.000000), (1481: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1438: 1), (1441: 3), (1447: 3), (1448: 3), (1465: 2), (1469: 3), (1481: 4), (1505: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

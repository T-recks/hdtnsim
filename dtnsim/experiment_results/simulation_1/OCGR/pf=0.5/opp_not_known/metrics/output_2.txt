The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1036(10 to 6), 1052(1 to 11), 1055(1 to 6), 1056(5 to 10), 1084(4 to 1), 1085(9 to 12), 1103(3 to 9), 1132(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1084: 140.000000), (1085: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1036: 1), (1052: 2), (1055: 1), (1056: 4), (1084: 6), (1085: 3), (1103: 2), (1132: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

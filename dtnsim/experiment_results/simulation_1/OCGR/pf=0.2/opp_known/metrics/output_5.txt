The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(10 to 6), 221(1 to 11), 230(1 to 6), 231(5 to 10), 248(4 to 1), 254(9 to 12), 268(3 to 9), 291(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(215: 45.000000), (221: 35.000000), (230: 15.000000), (231: 35.000000), (254: 0.000000), (268: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 4), (221: 3), (230: 3), (231: 3), (248: 4), (254: 3), (268: 4), (291: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
212(10 to 6), 218(1 to 11), 226(1 to 6), 227(5 to 10), 233(4 to 1), 237(9 to 12), 251(3 to 9), 259(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(212: 45.000000), (218: 35.000000), (226: 25.000000), (227: 55.000000), (237: 55.000000), (251: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(212: 4), (218: 3), (226: 2), (227: 4), (233: 3), (237: 4), (251: 4), (259: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
287(10 to 6), 290(1 to 11), 292(1 to 6), 293(5 to 10), 295(4 to 1), 297(9 to 12), 301(3 to 9), 304(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(292: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(287: 1), (290: 2), (292: 2), (293: 1), (295: 1), (297: 1), (301: 2), (304: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 290: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 292: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 290: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 292: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 301: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 295: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 293: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 297: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 287: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), 
Node 11: 
Node 12: 
Bundle 304: (to: 6, time: 110.000000),

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
309(10 to 6), 312(1 to 11), 316(1 to 6), 317(5 to 10), 323(4 to 1), 326(9 to 12), 337(3 to 9), 344(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(312: 35.000000), (316: 65.000000), (317: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(309: 3), (312: 4), (316: 3), (317: 3), (323: 1), (326: 3), (337: 2), (344: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

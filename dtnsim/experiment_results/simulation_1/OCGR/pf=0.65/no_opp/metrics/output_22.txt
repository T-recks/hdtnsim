The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
260(10 to 6), 262(1 to 11), 265(1 to 6), 266(5 to 10), 270(4 to 1), 273(9 to 12), 277(3 to 9), 281(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(265: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(260: 1), (262: 3), (265: 3), (266: 1), (270: 1), (273: 2), (277: 4), (281: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 262: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 265: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3:

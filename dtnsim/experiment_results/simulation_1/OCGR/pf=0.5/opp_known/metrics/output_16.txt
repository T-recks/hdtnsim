The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
490(10 to 6), 492(1 to 11), 495(1 to 6), 496(5 to 10), 512(4 to 1), 513(9 to 12), 518(3 to 9), 539(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(512: 60.000000), (513: 55.000000), (518: 15.000000), (539: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(490: 1), (492: 2), (495: 1), (496: 4), (512: 4), (513: 4), (518: 4), (539: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

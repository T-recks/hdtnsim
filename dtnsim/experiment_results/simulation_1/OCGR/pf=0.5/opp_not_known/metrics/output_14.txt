The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1890(10 to 6), 1905(1 to 11), 1909(1 to 6), 1910(5 to 10), 1938(4 to 1), 1939(9 to 12), 1958(3 to 9), 1991(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1910: 55.000000), (1938: 140.000000), (1991: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1890: 1), (1905: 2), (1909: 1), (1910: 5), (1938: 6), (1939: 4), (1958: 2), (1991: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

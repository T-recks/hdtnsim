The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1366(10 to 6), 1369(1 to 11), 1374(1 to 6), 1375(5 to 10), 1392(4 to 1), 1396(9 to 12), 1407(3 to 9), 1430(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1369: 35.000000), (1374: 15.000000), (1375: 35.000000), (1396: 0.000000), (1407: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1366: 1), (1369: 3), (1374: 3), (1375: 3), (1392: 2), (1396: 3), (1407: 4), (1430: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
496(10 to 6), 501(1 to 11), 508(1 to 6), 509(5 to 10), 513(4 to 1), 518(9 to 12), 525(3 to 9), 532(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(496: 45.000000), (508: 25.000000), (525: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(496: 4), (501: 3), (508: 2), (509: 1), (513: 4), (518: 1), (525: 5), (532: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

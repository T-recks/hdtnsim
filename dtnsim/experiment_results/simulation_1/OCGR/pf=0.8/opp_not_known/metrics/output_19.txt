The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1714(10 to 6), 1728(1 to 11), 1731(1 to 6), 1732(5 to 10), 1758(4 to 1), 1759(9 to 12), 1775(3 to 9), 1804(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1714: 1), (1728: 2), (1731: 1), (1732: 5), (1758: 4), (1759: 4), (1775: 2), (1804: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

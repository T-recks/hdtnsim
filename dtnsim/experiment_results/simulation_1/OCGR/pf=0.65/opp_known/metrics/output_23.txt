The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1063(10 to 6), 1067(1 to 11), 1071(1 to 6), 1072(5 to 10), 1090(4 to 1), 1092(9 to 12), 1099(3 to 9), 1120(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1092: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1063: 1), (1067: 3), (1071: 1), (1072: 9), (1090: 4), (1092: 3), (1099: 5), (1120: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

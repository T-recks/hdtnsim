The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1021(10 to 6), 1036(1 to 11), 1039(1 to 6), 1040(5 to 10), 1069(4 to 1), 1074(9 to 12), 1096(3 to 9), 1130(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1036: 35.000000), (1039: 15.000000), (1040: 35.000000), (1074: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1021: 1), (1036: 4), (1039: 3), (1040: 3), (1069: 3), (1074: 3), (1096: 4), (1130: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

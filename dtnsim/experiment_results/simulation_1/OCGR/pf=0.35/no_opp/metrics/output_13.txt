The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
435(10 to 6), 442(1 to 11), 449(1 to 6), 450(5 to 10), 454(4 to 1), 456(9 to 12), 468(3 to 9), 478(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(435: 55.000000), (449: 25.000000), (456: 55.000000), (468: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(435: 4), (442: 3), (449: 2), (450: 2), (454: 4), (456: 4), (468: 4), (478: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1257(10 to 6), 1260(1 to 11), 1263(1 to 6), 1264(5 to 10), 1280(4 to 1), 1282(9 to 12), 1286(3 to 9), 1304(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1260: 65.000000), (1286: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1257: 1), (1260: 5), (1263: 1), (1264: 5), (1280: 2), (1282: 4), (1286: 7), (1304: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

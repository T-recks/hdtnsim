The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
448(10 to 6), 454(1 to 11), 462(1 to 6), 463(5 to 10), 468(4 to 1), 470(9 to 12), 478(3 to 9), 487(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(454: 35.000000), (462: 65.000000), (463: 35.000000), (468: 60.000000), (478: 65.000000), (487: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(448: 1), (454: 3), (462: 3), (463: 3), (468: 4), (470: 1), (478: 4), (487: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

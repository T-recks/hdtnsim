The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
661(10 to 6), 679(1 to 11), 687(1 to 6), 688(5 to 10), 718(4 to 1), 724(9 to 12), 750(3 to 9), 781(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(661: 45.000000), (679: 35.000000), (687: 15.000000), (688: 55.000000), (724: 0.000000), (750: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(661: 4), (679: 3), (687: 3), (688: 4), (718: 3), (724: 3), (750: 4), (781: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1313(10 to 6), 1316(1 to 11), 1320(1 to 6), 1321(5 to 10), 1338(4 to 1), 1342(9 to 12), 1353(3 to 9), 1375(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1316: 35.000000), (1320: 15.000000), (1321: 35.000000), (1342: 0.000000), (1353: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1313: 1), (1316: 3), (1320: 3), (1321: 3), (1338: 2), (1342: 3), (1353: 4), (1375: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

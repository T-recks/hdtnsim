The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
217(10 to 6), 233(1 to 11), 240(1 to 6), 241(5 to 10), 271(4 to 1), 275(9 to 12), 295(3 to 9), 326(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(240: 15.000000), (241: 35.000000), (271: 140.000000), (275: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(217: 1), (233: 2), (240: 3), (241: 3), (271: 6), (275: 3), (295: 3), (326: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

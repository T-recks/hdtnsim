The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
502(10 to 6), 505(1 to 11), 509(1 to 6), 510(5 to 10), 526(4 to 1), 531(9 to 12), 536(3 to 9), 562(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(502: 105.000000), (505: 65.000000), (509: 15.000000), (526: 60.000000), (531: 55.000000), (536: 15.000000), (562: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(502: 5), (505: 6), (509: 3), (510: 5), (526: 4), (531: 4), (536: 6), (562: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

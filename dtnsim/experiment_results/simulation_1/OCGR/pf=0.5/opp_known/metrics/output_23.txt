The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1091(10 to 6), 1096(1 to 11), 1103(1 to 6), 1104(5 to 10), 1121(4 to 1), 1122(9 to 12), 1128(3 to 9), 1150(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1122: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1091: 1), (1096: 3), (1103: 1), (1104: 5), (1121: 4), (1122: 3), (1128: 5), (1150: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

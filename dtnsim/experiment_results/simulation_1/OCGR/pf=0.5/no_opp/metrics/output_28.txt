The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
383(10 to 6), 386(1 to 11), 391(1 to 6), 392(5 to 10), 395(4 to 1), 396(9 to 12), 401(3 to 9), 407(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(383: 1), (386: 2), (391: 1), (392: 2), (395: 4), (396: 1), (401: 2), (407: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

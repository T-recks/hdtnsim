The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1235(10 to 6), 1237(1 to 11), 1240(1 to 6), 1241(5 to 10), 1255(4 to 1), 1256(9 to 12), 1260(3 to 9), 1279(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1235: 1), (1237: 2), (1240: 1), (1241: 5), (1255: 4), (1256: 4), (1260: 5), (1279: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

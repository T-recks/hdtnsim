The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
533(10 to 6), 536(1 to 11), 542(1 to 6), 543(5 to 10), 548(4 to 1), 549(9 to 12), 561(3 to 9), 566(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(536: 35.000000), (543: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(533: 1), (536: 3), (542: 1), (543: 3), (548: 1), (549: 3), (561: 2), (566: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1914(10 to 6), 1929(1 to 11), 1935(1 to 6), 1936(5 to 10), 1965(4 to 1), 1969(9 to 12), 1993(3 to 9), 2027(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1929: 35.000000), (1935: 15.000000), (1936: 35.000000), (1969: 0.000000), (1993: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1914: 1), (1929: 3), (1935: 3), (1936: 3), (1965: 2), (1969: 3), (1993: 5), (2027: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

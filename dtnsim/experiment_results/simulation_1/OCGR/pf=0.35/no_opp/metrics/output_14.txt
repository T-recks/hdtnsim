The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
564(10 to 6), 568(1 to 11), 573(1 to 6), 574(5 to 10), 578(4 to 1), 579(9 to 12), 589(3 to 9), 598(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(568: 35.000000), (574: 35.000000), (598: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(564: 1), (568: 3), (573: 1), (574: 3), (578: 2), (579: 2), (589: 3), (598: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

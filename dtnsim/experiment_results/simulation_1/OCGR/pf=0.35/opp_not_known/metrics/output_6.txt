The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
656(10 to 6), 673(1 to 11), 679(1 to 6), 680(5 to 10), 710(4 to 1), 714(9 to 12), 737(3 to 9), 772(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(656: 45.000000), (680: 35.000000), (714: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(656: 4), (673: 2), (679: 1), (680: 7), (710: 3), (714: 3), (737: 4), (772: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

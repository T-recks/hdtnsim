The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1743(10 to 6), 1757(1 to 11), 1758(1 to 6), 1759(5 to 10), 1788(4 to 1), 1789(9 to 12), 1805(3 to 9), 1834(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1789: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1743: 1), (1757: 2), (1758: 1), (1759: 4), (1788: 4), (1789: 3), (1805: 2), (1834: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1245(10 to 6), 1249(1 to 11), 1252(1 to 6), 1253(5 to 10), 1270(4 to 1), 1272(9 to 12), 1279(3 to 9), 1298(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1249: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1245: 1), (1249: 5), (1252: 1), (1253: 5), (1270: 4), (1272: 4), (1279: 2), (1298: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

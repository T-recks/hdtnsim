The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
339(10 to 6), 343(1 to 11), 347(1 to 6), 348(5 to 10), 354(4 to 1), 357(9 to 12), 368(3 to 9), 375(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(343: 35.000000), (347: 65.000000), (348: 35.000000), (375: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(339: 3), (343: 4), (347: 3), (348: 3), (354: 1), (357: 3), (368: 2), (375: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

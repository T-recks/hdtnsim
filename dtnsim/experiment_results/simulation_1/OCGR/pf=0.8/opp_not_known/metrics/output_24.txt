The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1741(10 to 6), 1757(1 to 11), 1759(1 to 6), 1760(5 to 10), 1787(4 to 1), 1788(9 to 12), 1805(3 to 9), 1834(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1741: 3), (1757: 2), (1759: 1), (1760: 4), (1787: 4), (1788: 4), (1805: 2), (1834: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 39 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
991(10 to 6), 1006(1 to 11), 1009(1 to 6), 1010(5 to 10), 1039(4 to 1), 1044(9 to 12), 1066(3 to 9), 1099(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1006: 35.000000), (1009: 15.000000), (1010: 35.000000), (1044: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(991: 1), (1006: 4), (1009: 3), (1010: 3), (1039: 4), (1044: 3), (1066: 2), (1099: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

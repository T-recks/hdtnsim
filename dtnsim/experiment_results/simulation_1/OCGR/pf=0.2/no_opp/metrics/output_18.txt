The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
483(10 to 6), 489(1 to 11), 497(1 to 6), 498(5 to 10), 502(4 to 1), 505(9 to 12), 516(3 to 9), 525(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(483: 45.000000), (489: 35.000000), (498: 35.000000), (502: 60.000000), (516: 65.000000), (525: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(483: 4), (489: 3), (497: 1), (498: 3), (502: 4), (505: 1), (516: 4), (525: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

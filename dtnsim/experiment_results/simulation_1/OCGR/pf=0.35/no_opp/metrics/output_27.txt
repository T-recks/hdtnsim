The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
310(10 to 6), 315(1 to 11), 320(1 to 6), 321(5 to 10), 327(4 to 1), 329(9 to 12), 340(3 to 9), 351(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(315: 35.000000), (320: 25.000000), (321: 35.000000), (340: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(310: 1), (315: 3), (320: 2), (321: 3), (327: 3), (329: 2), (340: 4), (351: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

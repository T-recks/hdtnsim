The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
652(10 to 6), 667(1 to 11), 673(1 to 6), 674(5 to 10), 703(4 to 1), 706(9 to 12), 729(3 to 9), 760(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(652: 105.000000), (674: 35.000000), (706: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(652: 5), (667: 2), (673: 1), (674: 7), (703: 5), (706: 3), (729: 3), (760: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

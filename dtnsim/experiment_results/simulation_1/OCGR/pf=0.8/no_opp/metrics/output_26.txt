The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
122(10 to 6), 124(1 to 11), 125(1 to 6), 126(5 to 10), 127(4 to 1), 128(9 to 12), 131(3 to 9), 136(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(122: 4), (124: 2), (125: 1), (126: 1), (127: 2), (128: 1), (131: 2), (136: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 124: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

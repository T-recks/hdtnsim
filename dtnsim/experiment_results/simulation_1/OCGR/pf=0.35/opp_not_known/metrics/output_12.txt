The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1068(10 to 6), 1083(1 to 11), 1087(1 to 6), 1088(5 to 10), 1118(4 to 1), 1123(9 to 12), 1147(3 to 9), 1180(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1083: 35.000000), (1087: 15.000000), (1088: 35.000000), (1118: 140.000000), (1123: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1068: 3), (1083: 4), (1087: 3), (1088: 3), (1118: 6), (1123: 3), (1147: 2), (1180: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

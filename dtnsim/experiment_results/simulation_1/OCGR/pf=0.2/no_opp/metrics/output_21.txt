The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
221(10 to 6), 225(1 to 11), 233(1 to 6), 234(5 to 10), 238(4 to 1), 240(9 to 12), 251(3 to 9), 261(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(221: 105.000000), (234: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(221: 5), (225: 2), (233: 1), (234: 3), (238: 2), (240: 4), (251: 3), (261: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

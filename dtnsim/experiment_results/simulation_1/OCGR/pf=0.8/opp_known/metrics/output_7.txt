The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
736(10 to 6), 738(1 to 11), 740(1 to 6), 741(5 to 10), 757(4 to 1), 758(9 to 12), 764(3 to 9), 782(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(758: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(736: 1), (738: 3), (740: 1), (741: 4), (757: 5), (758: 3), (764: 5), (782: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

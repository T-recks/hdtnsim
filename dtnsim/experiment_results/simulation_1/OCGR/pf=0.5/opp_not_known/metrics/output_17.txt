The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1028(10 to 6), 1042(1 to 11), 1047(1 to 6), 1048(5 to 10), 1076(4 to 1), 1077(9 to 12), 1100(3 to 9), 1132(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1042: 35.000000), (1077: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1028: 1), (1042: 3), (1047: 1), (1048: 4), (1076: 3), (1077: 4), (1100: 4), (1132: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

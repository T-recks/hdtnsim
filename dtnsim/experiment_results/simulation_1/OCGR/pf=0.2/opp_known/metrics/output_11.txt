The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
534(10 to 6), 539(1 to 11), 545(1 to 6), 546(5 to 10), 562(4 to 1), 567(9 to 12), 573(3 to 9), 599(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(534: 105.000000), (539: 65.000000), (545: 15.000000), (546: 55.000000), (562: 60.000000), (567: 55.000000), (573: 15.000000), (599: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(534: 6), (539: 6), (545: 3), (546: 5), (562: 4), (567: 4), (573: 6), (599: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

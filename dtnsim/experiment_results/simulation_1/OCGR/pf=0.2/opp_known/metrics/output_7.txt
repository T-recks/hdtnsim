The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
870(10 to 6), 876(1 to 11), 883(1 to 6), 884(5 to 10), 902(4 to 1), 906(9 to 12), 918(3 to 9), 943(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(870: 105.000000), (876: 35.000000), (883: 15.000000), (884: 35.000000), (902: 60.000000), (906: 0.000000), (918: 15.000000), (943: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (8/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(870: 5), (876: 3), (883: 3), (884: 3), (902: 4), (906: 3), (918: 4), (943: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

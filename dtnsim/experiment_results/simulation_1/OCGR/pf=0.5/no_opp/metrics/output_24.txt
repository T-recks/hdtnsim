The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
487(10 to 6), 492(1 to 11), 496(1 to 6), 497(5 to 10), 499(4 to 1), 500(9 to 12), 504(3 to 9), 514(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(504: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(487: 5), (492: 2), (496: 1), (497: 1), (499: 3), (500: 1), (504: 4), (514: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

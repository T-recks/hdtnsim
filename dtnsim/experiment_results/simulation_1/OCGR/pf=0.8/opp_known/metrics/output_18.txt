The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
973(10 to 6), 975(1 to 11), 978(1 to 6), 979(5 to 10), 995(4 to 1), 996(9 to 12), 1003(3 to 9), 1020(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(996: 0.000000), (1003: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(973: 1), (975: 2), (978: 1), (979: 4), (995: 4), (996: 3), (1003: 7), (1020: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(10 to 6), 243(1 to 11), 250(1 to 6), 251(5 to 10), 281(4 to 1), 285(9 to 12), 309(3 to 9), 342(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(243: 35.000000), (250: 15.000000), (251: 35.000000), (281: 140.000000), (285: 0.000000), (342: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 1), (243: 3), (250: 3), (251: 3), (281: 6), (285: 3), (309: 2), (342: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

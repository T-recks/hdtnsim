The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
554(10 to 6), 557(1 to 11), 563(1 to 6), 564(5 to 10), 569(4 to 1), 571(9 to 12), 582(3 to 9), 592(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(557: 35.000000), (563: 25.000000), (564: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(554: 1), (557: 3), (563: 2), (564: 3), (569: 2), (571: 2), (582: 3), (592: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

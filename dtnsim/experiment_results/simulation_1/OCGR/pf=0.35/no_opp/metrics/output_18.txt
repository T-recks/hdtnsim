The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
415(10 to 6), 419(1 to 11), 424(1 to 6), 425(5 to 10), 428(4 to 1), 431(9 to 12), 438(3 to 9), 446(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(415: 45.000000), (428: 60.000000), (446: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(415: 4), (419: 2), (424: 1), (425: 1), (428: 4), (431: 1), (438: 4), (446: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

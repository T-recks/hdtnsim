The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1475(10 to 6), 1491(1 to 11), 1496(1 to 6), 1497(5 to 10), 1526(4 to 1), 1529(9 to 12), 1551(3 to 9), 1583(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1475: 45.000000), (1526: 60.000000), (1529: 0.000000), (1583: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1475: 4), (1491: 2), (1496: 1), (1497: 4), (1526: 4), (1529: 3), (1551: 4), (1583: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

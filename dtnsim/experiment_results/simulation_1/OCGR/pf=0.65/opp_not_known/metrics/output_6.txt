The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
605(10 to 6), 621(1 to 11), 623(1 to 6), 624(5 to 10), 653(4 to 1), 655(9 to 12), 674(3 to 9), 705(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(624: 55.000000), (655: 0.000000), (674: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(605: 3), (621: 2), (623: 1), (624: 9), (653: 5), (655: 3), (674: 6), (705: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
779(10 to 6), 782(1 to 11), 786(1 to 6), 787(5 to 10), 802(4 to 1), 803(9 to 12), 809(3 to 9), 830(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(787: 55.000000), (803: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(779: 3), (782: 2), (786: 1), (787: 5), (802: 5), (803: 4), (809: 2), (830: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

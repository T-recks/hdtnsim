The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1259(10 to 6), 1263(1 to 11), 1265(1 to 6), 1266(5 to 10), 1281(4 to 1), 1282(9 to 12), 1287(3 to 9), 1304(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1259: 3), (1263: 2), (1265: 1), (1266: 4), (1281: 4), (1282: 4), (1287: 2), (1304: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 29 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

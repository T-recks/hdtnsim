The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1496(10 to 6), 1501(1 to 11), 1509(1 to 6), 1510(5 to 10), 1527(4 to 1), 1532(9 to 12), 1546(3 to 9), 1571(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1496: 105.000000), (1501: 35.000000), (1509: 15.000000), (1510: 35.000000), (1532: 0.000000), (1546: 15.000000), (1571: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1496: 5), (1501: 3), (1509: 3), (1510: 3), (1527: 2), (1532: 3), (1546: 4), (1571: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

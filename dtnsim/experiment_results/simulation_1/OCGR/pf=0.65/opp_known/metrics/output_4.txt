The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1295(10 to 6), 1299(1 to 11), 1302(1 to 6), 1303(5 to 10), 1321(4 to 1), 1326(9 to 12), 1334(3 to 9), 1356(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1299: 55.000000), (1302: 15.000000), (1334: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1295: 1), (1299: 5), (1302: 3), (1303: 5), (1321: 2), (1326: 4), (1334: 4), (1356: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1029(10 to 6), 1031(1 to 11), 1035(1 to 6), 1036(5 to 10), 1051(4 to 1), 1052(9 to 12), 1059(3 to 9), 1082(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1052: 0.000000), (1059: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1029: 1), (1031: 2), (1035: 1), (1036: 5), (1051: 4), (1052: 3), (1059: 6), (1082: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

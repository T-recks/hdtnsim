The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(10 to 6), 217(1 to 11), 219(1 to 6), 220(5 to 10), 221(4 to 1), 222(9 to 12), 224(3 to 9), 226(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 1), (217: 2), (219: 1), (220: 1), (221: 1), (222: 1), (224: 2), (226: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 18 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 217: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 219: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 217: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 224: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 221: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 220: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 222: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10: 
Bundle 215: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), 
Node 11:

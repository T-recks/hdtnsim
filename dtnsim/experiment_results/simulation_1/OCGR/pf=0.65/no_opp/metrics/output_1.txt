The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
154(10 to 6), 156(1 to 11), 160(1 to 6), 161(5 to 10), 164(4 to 1), 165(9 to 12), 171(3 to 9), 177(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(154: 4), (156: 2), (160: 1), (161: 1), (164: 2), (165: 4), (171: 2), (177: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

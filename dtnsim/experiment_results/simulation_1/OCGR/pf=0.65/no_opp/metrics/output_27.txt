The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
239(10 to 6), 242(1 to 11), 245(1 to 6), 246(5 to 10), 251(4 to 1), 254(9 to 12), 261(3 to 9), 268(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(242: 35.000000), (246: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(239: 1), (242: 4), (245: 3), (246: 3), (251: 1), (254: 1), (261: 2), (268: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 242: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

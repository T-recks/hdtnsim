The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1396(10 to 6), 1410(1 to 11), 1414(1 to 6), 1415(5 to 10), 1442(4 to 1), 1443(9 to 12), 1462(3 to 9), 1492(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1443: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1396: 1), (1410: 2), (1414: 1), (1415: 5), (1442: 4), (1443: 3), (1462: 2), (1492: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 34 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
200(10 to 6), 202(1 to 11), 204(1 to 6), 205(5 to 10), 208(4 to 1), 211(9 to 12), 215(3 to 9), 220(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(200: 1), (202: 4), (204: 3), (205: 1), (208: 1), (211: 1), (215: 2), (220: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 22 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 202: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
757(10 to 6), 759(1 to 11), 763(1 to 6), 764(5 to 10), 781(4 to 1), 785(9 to 12), 791(3 to 9), 809(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(763: 15.000000), (781: 140.000000), (785: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(757: 1), (759: 3), (763: 3), (764: 4), (781: 6), (785: 3), (791: 5), (809: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

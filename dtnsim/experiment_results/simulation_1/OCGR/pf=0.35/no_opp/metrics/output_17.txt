The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
299(10 to 6), 302(1 to 11), 308(1 to 6), 309(5 to 10), 311(4 to 1), 312(9 to 12), 322(3 to 9), 331(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(299: 55.000000), (302: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(299: 4), (302: 3), (308: 1), (309: 1), (311: 3), (312: 1), (322: 4), (331: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1023(10 to 6), 1025(1 to 11), 1029(1 to 6), 1030(5 to 10), 1045(4 to 1), 1046(9 to 12), 1051(3 to 9), 1070(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1051: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1023: 1), (1025: 2), (1029: 1), (1030: 4), (1045: 4), (1046: 4), (1051: 7), (1070: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
869(10 to 6), 874(1 to 11), 880(1 to 6), 881(5 to 10), 897(4 to 1), 901(9 to 12), 914(3 to 9), 936(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(874: 35.000000), (880: 15.000000), (881: 35.000000), (897: 140.000000), (901: 0.000000), (936: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (6/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(869: 1), (874: 3), (880: 3), (881: 3), (897: 6), (901: 3), (914: 2), (936: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

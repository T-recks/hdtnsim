The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
983(10 to 6), 984(1 to 11), 988(1 to 6), 989(5 to 10), 1004(4 to 1), 1005(9 to 12), 1011(3 to 9), 1034(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1005: 0.000000), (1011: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(983: 1), (984: 2), (988: 1), (989: 5), (1004: 4), (1005: 3), (1011: 6), (1034: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:

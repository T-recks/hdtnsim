The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
996(10 to 6), 997(1 to 11), 999(1 to 6), 1000(5 to 10), 1017(4 to 1), 1018(9 to 12), 1024(3 to 9), 1042(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1018: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(996: 1), (997: 2), (999: 1), (1000: 4), (1017: 4), (1018: 3), (1024: 5), (1042: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 28 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 997: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),

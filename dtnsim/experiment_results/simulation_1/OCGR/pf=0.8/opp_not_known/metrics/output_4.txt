The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1726(10 to 6), 1742(1 to 11), 1745(1 to 6), 1746(5 to 10), 1775(4 to 1), 1777(9 to 12), 1796(3 to 9), 1827(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1742: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1726: 1), (1742: 5), (1745: 1), (1746: 5), (1775: 4), (1777: 4), (1796: 2), (1827: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 36 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------

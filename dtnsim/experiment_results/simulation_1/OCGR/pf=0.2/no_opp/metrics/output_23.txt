The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
482(10 to 6), 488(1 to 11), 497(1 to 6), 498(5 to 10), 504(4 to 1), 508(9 to 12), 516(3 to 9), 525(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(482: 45.000000), (497: 25.000000), (508: 55.000000), (516: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(482: 4), (488: 2), (497: 2), (498: 2), (504: 3), (508: 4), (516: 5), (525: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 27 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
